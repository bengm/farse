Subpart 52.2 sets forth the text of all FAR provisions and clauses, each in its own separate subsection. The subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the FAR. Each FAR provision or clause is uniquely identified. All FAR provision and clause numbers begin with “52.2,” since the text of all FAR provisions and clauses appear in Subpart 52.2. The next two digits of the provision or clause number correspond to the number of the FAR subject part in which the provision or clause is prescribed. The FAR provision or clause number is then completed by a hyphen and a sequential number assigned within each section of Subpart 52.2. The following example illustrates the makeup of the FAR provision or clause number (see Figure 1 below).","type":"outline","level":1},{"text":"","type":"paragraph","level":null},{"text":"(2)(i) Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR.
