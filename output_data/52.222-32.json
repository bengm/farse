The total of these computations for each craft will be added to the current contract unit price to obtain the new contract unit price. The extended amount for the contract line item will be obtained by multiplying the new unit price by the estimated quantity. If actual hours are not available from the preceding contract period for computation of the adjustment for a specific contract unit of work, the Contractor, in agreement with the Contracting Officer, shall estimate the total hours per craft per contract unit of work.","type":"outline","level":1}]}
