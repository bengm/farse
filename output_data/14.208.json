Amendments shall be sent, before the time for bid opening, to everyone to whom invitations have been furnished and shall be displayed in the bid room.","type":"paragraph","level":null},{"text":"(b) Before amending an invitation for bids, the period of time remaining until bid opening and the need to extend this period shall be considered. When only a short time remains before the time set for bid opening, consideration should be given to notifying bidders of an extension of time by telegrams or telephone. Such extension must be confirmed in the amendment.","type":"paragraph","level":null},{"text":"(c) Any information given to a prospective bidder concerning an invitation for bids shall be furnished promptly to all other prospective bidders as an amendment to the invitation (1) if such information is necessary for bidders to submit bids or (2) if the lack of such information would be prejudicial to uninformed bidders. The information shall be furnished even though a pre-bid conference is held. No award shall be made on the invitation unless such amendment has been issued in sufficient time to permit all prospective bidders to consider such information in submitting or modifying their bids.","type":"paragraph","level":null}]}
