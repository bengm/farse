{"number":"27.405-3","title":"Commercial computer software.","children":[{"text":"(a) When contracting other than from GSA’s Multiple Award Schedule contracts for the acquisition of commercial computer software, no specific contract clause prescribed in this subpart need be used, but the contract shall specifically address the Government’s rights to use, disclose, modify, distribute, and reproduce the software. Section 12.212 sets forth the guidance for the acquisition of commercial computer software and states that commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation shall be acquired under licenses customarily provided to the public to the extent the license is consistent with Federal law and otherwise satisfies the Government’s needs. The clause at 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software License, may be used when there is any confusion as to whether the Government’s needs are satisfied or whether a customary commercial license is consistent with Federal law. Additional or lesser rights may be negotiated using the guidance concerning restricted rights as set forth in 27.404-2(d), or the clause at 52.227-19. If greater rights than the minimum rights identified in the clause at 52.227-19 are needed, or lesser rights are to be acquired, they shall be negotiated and set forth in the contract. This includes any additions to, or limitations on, the rights set forth in paragraph (b) of the clause at 52.227-19 when used. Examples of greater rights may be those necessary for networking purposes or use of the software from remote terminals communicating with a host computer where the software is located. If the computer software is to be acquired with unlimited rights, the contract shall also so state. In addition, the contract shall adequately describe the computer programs and/or databases, the media on which it is recorded, and all the necessary documentation.","type":"paragraph","level":null},{"text":"(b) If the contract incorporates, makes reference to, or uses a vendor’s standard commercial lease, license, or purchase agreement, the contracting officer shall ensure that the agreement is consistent with paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection. The contracting officer should exercise caution in accepting a vendor’s terms and conditions, since they may be directed to commercial sales and may not be appropriate for Government contracts. Any inconsistencies in a vendor’s standard commercial agreement shall be addressed in the contract and the contract terms shall take precedence over the vendor’s standard commercial agreement. If the clause at 52.227-19 is used, inconsistencies in the vendor’s standard commercial agreement regarding the Government’s right to use, reproduce or disclose the computer software are reconciled by that clause.","type":"paragraph","level":null},{"text":"(c) If a prime contractor under a contract containing the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, with paragraph (g)(4) (Alternate III) in the clause, acquires restricted computer software from a subcontractor (at any tier) as a separate acquisition for delivery to or for use on behalf of the Government, the contracting officer may approve any additions to, or limitations on the restricted rights in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) in a collateral agreement incorporated in and made part of the contract.","type":"paragraph","level":null}]}
