(a)(1) The head of the agency or designee shall, before establishing a qualification requirement, prepare a written justification—</p>
<a name="wp1078902"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Stating the necessity for establishing the qualification requirement and specifying why the qualification requirement must be demonstrated before contract award;</p>

(ii) Estimating the likely costs for testing and evaluation which will be incurred by the potential offeror to become qualified; and</p>
<a name="wp1078904"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Specifying all requirements that a potential offeror (or its product) must satisfy in order to become qualified. Only those requirements which are the least restrictive to meet the purposes necessitating the establishment of the qualification requirements shall be specified.</p>

(ii) At their expense (but see <a href="#wp1078929">9.204</a>(a)(2) with regard to small businesses), a prompt opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification using qualified personnel and facilities of the agency concerned, or of another agency obtained through interagency agreements or under contract, or other methods approved by the agency (including use of approved testing and evaluation services not provided under contract to the agency).
      </p>
<a name="wp1078908"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

(4) A potential offeror seeking qualification shall be promptly informed as to whether qualification is attained and, in the event it is not, promptly furnished specific reasons why qualification was not attained.</p>
<a name="wp1078912"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) When justified under the circumstances, the agency activity responsible for establishing a qualification requirement shall submit to the advocate for competition for the procuring activity responsible for purchasing the item subject to the qualification requirement, a determination that it is unreasonable to specify the standards for qualification which a prospective offeror (or its product) must satisfy. After considering any comments of the advocate for competition reviewing the determination, the head of the procuring activity may waive the requirements of <a href="#wp1078900">9.202</a>(a)(1)(ii) through (4) for up to 2 years with respect to the item subject to the qualification requirement. A copy of the waiver shall be furnished to the head of the agency or other official responsible for actions under <a href="#wp1078900">9.202</a>(a)(1). The waiver authority provided in this paragraph does not apply with respect to qualification requirements contained in a QPL, QML, or QBL.

<a name="wp1078913"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) If a potential offeror can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the contracting officer that the potential offeror (or its product) meets the standards established for qualification or can meet them before the date specified for award of the contract, a potential offeror may not be denied the opportunity to submit and have considered an offer for a contract solely because the potential offeror—</p>

      </p>
<a name="wp1078918"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) The contracting officer need not delay a proposed award in order to provide a potential offeror with an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to meet the standards specified for qualification.

(a) Qualification and listing in a QPL, QML, or QBL is the process by which products are obtained from manufacturers or distributors, examined and tested for compliance with specification requirements, or manufacturers or potential offerors, are provided an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities to meet the standards specified for qualification. The names of successful products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included on lists evidencing their status. Generally, qualification is performed in advance and independently of any specific acquisition action. After qualification, the products, manufacturers, or potential offerors are included in a Federal or Military QPL, QML, or QBL. (See <a href="#wp1078900">9.202</a>(a)(2) with regard to any product, manufacturer, or potential offeror not yet included on an applicable list.)

9.204  Responsibilities for establishment of a qualification requirement.</h3>
<a name="wp1078930"> </a><p class="pBody">
The responsibilities of agency activities that establish qualification requirements include the following:</p>
<a name="wp1078931"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Arranging publicity for the qualification requirements. If active competition on anticipated future qualification requirements is likely to be fewer than two manufacturers or the products of two manufacturers, the activity responsible for establishment of the qualification requirements must—</p>
<a name="wp1078932"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Periodically furnish through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) a notice seeking additional sources or products for qualification unless the contracting officer determines that such publication would compromise the national security.</p>
<a name="wp1078933"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Bear the cost of conducting the specified testing and evaluation (excluding the costs associated with producing the item or establishing the production, quality control, or other system to be tested and evaluated) for a small business concern or a product manufactured by a small business concern which has met the standards specified for qualification and which could reasonably be expected to compete for a contract for that requirement. However, such costs may be borne only if it is determined in accordance with agency procedures that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within a reasonable period of time, considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements. A prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs must certify as to its status as a small business concern under Section 3 of the Small Business Act in order to receive further consideration.</p>
<a name="wp1078934"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Qualifying products that meet specification requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1078935"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Listing manufacturers and suppliers whose products are qualified in accordance with agency procedures.</p>

<a name="wp1078937"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Clarifying, as necessary, qualification requirements.</p>

(5) Use of the list for advertising or publicity is permitted. However, it must not be stated or implied that a particular product or source is the only product or source of that type qualified, or that the Government in any way recommends or endorses the products or the sources listed.</p>

(i) Reexamining a qualified product or manufacturer when—</p>

9.205  Opportunity for qualification before award.</h3>
<a name="wp1078951"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) If an agency determines that a qualification requirement is necessary, the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement must urge manufacturers and other potential sources to demonstrate their ability to meet the standards specified for qualification and, when possible, give sufficient time to arrange for qualification before award.

9.206-1  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1078961"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Agencies may not enforce any QPL, QML, or QBL without first complying with the requirements of <a href="#wp1078900">9.202</a>(a). However, qualification requirements themselves, whether or not previously embodied in a in a QPL, QML, or QBL, may be enforced without regard to <a href="#wp1078900">9.202</a>(a) if they are in either of the following categories:
      </p>
<a name="wp1078962"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Any qualification requirement established by statute prior to October 30, 1984, for civilian agencies (not including NASA); or</p>

      </p>
<a name="wp1078964"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Except when the agency head or designee determines that an emergency exists, whenever an agency elects, whether before or after award, not to enforce a qualification requirement which it established, the requirement may not thereafter be enforced unless the agency complies with <a href="#wp1078900">9.202</a>(a).
      </p>
<a name="wp1078965"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) If a qualification requirement applies, the contracting officer need consider only those offers identified as meeting the requirement or included on the applicable QPL, QML, or QBL, unless an offeror can satisfactorily demonstrate to the contracting officer that it or its product or its subcontractor or its product can meet the standards established for qualification before the date specified for award.</p>
<a name="wp1078966"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) If a product subject to a qualification requirement is to be acquired as a component of an end item, the contracting officer must ensure that all such components and their qualification requirements are properly identified in the solicitation since the product or source must meet the standards specified for qualification before award.</p>

<a name="wp1078969"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Distribute solicitations to prospective contractors whether or not they have been identified as meeting applicable qualification requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1078970"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) When appropriate, request in accordance with agency procedures that a qualification requirement not be enforced in a particular acquisition and, if granted, so specify in the solicitation (see <a href="#wp1078960">9.206-1</a>(b)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1078971"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Forward requests from potential suppliers for information on a qualification requirement to the agency activity responsible for establishing the requirement.</p>
<a name="wp1078972"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
