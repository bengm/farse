Subpart 12.6—Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items</h2>
<a name="wp1088489"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
12.601  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1088490"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart provides optional procedures for (a) streamlined evaluation of offers for commercial items; and (b) streamlined solicitation of offers for commercial items for use where appropriate. These procedures are intended to simplify the process of preparing and issuing solicitations, and evaluating offers for commercial items consistent with customary commercial practices.</p>
<a name="wp1088491"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
12.602  Streamlined evaluation of offers.</h3>
<a name="wp1088492"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When evaluation factors are used, the contracting officer may insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at <a href="52_212_213.html#wp1179178">52.212-2</a>, Evaluation—Commercial Items, in solicitations for commercial items or comply with the procedures in <a href="Subpart%2013_1.html#wp1125466">13.106</a> if the acquisition is being made using simplified acquisition procedures. When the provision at <a href="52_212_213.html#wp1179178">52.212-2</a> is used, paragraph (a) of the provision shall be tailored to the specific acquisition to describe the evaluation factors and relative importance of those factors. However, when using the simplified acquisition procedures in <a href="FARTOCP13.html#wp271421">Part 13</a>, contracting officers are not required to describe the relative importance of evaluation factors.
      </p>
<a name="wp1088493"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Offers shall be evaluated in accordance with the criteria contained in the solicitation. For many commercial items, the criteria need not be more detailed than technical (capability of the item offered to meet the agency need), price and past performance. Technical capability may be evaluated by how well the proposed products meet the Government requirement instead of predetermined subfactors. Solicitations for commercial items do not have to contain subfactors for technical capability when the solicitation adequately describes the item&rsquo;s intended use. A technical evaluation would normally include examination of such things as product literature, product samples (if requested), technical features and warranty provisions. Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with the procedures in <a href="Subpart%2013_1.html#wp1125466">13.106</a> or <a href="Subpart%2015_3.html#wp1088864">Subpart 15.3</a>, as applicable. The contracting officer shall ensure the instructions provided in the provision at <a href="52_212_213.html#wp1179124">52.212-1</a>, Instructions to Offerors—Commercial Items, and the evaluation criteria provided in the provision at <a href="52_212_213.html#wp1179178">52.212-2</a>, Evaluation—Commercial Items, are in agreement.
      </p>
<a name="wp1088494"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Select the offer that is most advantageous to the Government based on the factors contained in the solicitation. Fully document the rationale for selection of the successful offeror including discussion of any trade-offs considered.</p>

12.603  Streamlined solicitation for commercial items.</h3>
<a name="wp1088496"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When a written solicitation will be issued, the contracting officer may use the following procedure to reduce the time required to solicit and award contracts for the acquisition of commercial items.
