(b) The TCO shall refer subcontract settlements received for approval or ratification to the appropriate audit agency for review and recommendations when (1) the amount exceeds $100,000 or (2) the TCO wants a complete or partial accounting review.

(c)(1) The responsibility of the prime contractor and of each subcontractor (see <a href="#wp1085188">49.108</a>) includes performance of accounting reviews and any necessary field audits.

Consistent with this, and when in the Government&rsquo;s interest, the TCO may furnish audit reports under paragraph (c) of this section to prime and higher tier subcontractors for their use in settling subcontract settlement proposals.</p>

A subcontractor has no contractual rights against the Government upon the termination of a prime contract. A subcontractor may have rights against the prime contractor or intermediate subcontractor with whom it has contracted.

(a) Termination for convenience clauses provide that after receipt of a termination notice the prime contractor shall, unless directed otherwise by the TCO, terminate all subcontracts to the extent that they relate to the performance of prime work terminated. Therefore, prime contractors should include a termination clause in their subcontracts for their own protection. Suggestions regarding use of subcontract termination clauses are in <a href="Subpart%2049_5.html#wp1078487">Subpart 49.5</a>.

The TCO shall allow reimbursement in excess of that amount only in unusual cases and then only to the extent that the terms of the subcontract did not unreasonably increase the rights of the subcontractor.
