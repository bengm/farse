(a) General wage determinations.</p>
<a name="wp1107299"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) A general wage determination contains prevailing wage rates for the types of construction designated in the determination, and is used in contracts performed within a specified geographical area. General wage determinations contain no expiration date and remain valid until modified, superseded, or canceled by the Department of Labor. Once incorporated in a contract, a general wage determination normally remains effective for the life of the contract, unless the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of the contract (see <a href="#wp1102097">22.404-12</a>). These determinations shall be used whenever possible. They are issued at the discretion of the Department of Labor either upon receipt of an agency request or on the Department of Labor&rsquo;s own initiative.
      </p>
<a name="wp1109140"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) General wage determinations are published on the WDOL website. General wage determinations are effective on the publication date of the wage determination or upon receipt of the wage determination by the contracting agency, whichever occurs first. &ldquo;Publication&rdquo; within the meaning of this section shall occur on the first date the wage determination is published on the WDOL. Archived Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute general wage determinations that are no longer current may be accessed in the &ldquo;Archived DB WD&rdquo; database on WDOL for information purposes only. Contracting officers may not use an archived wage determination in a contract action without obtaining prior approval of the Department of Labor. To obtain prior approval, contact the Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wdol.gov">http://www.wdol.gov</a>, or contact the procurement agency labor advisor listed on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wdol.gov">http://www.wdol.gov</a>.

(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Project wage determinations</em>. A project wage determination is issued at the specific request of a contracting agency. It is used only when no general wage determination applies, and is effective for 180 calendar days from the date of the determination. However, if a determination expires before contract award, it may be possible to obtain an extension to the 180-day life of the determination (see <a href="#wp1102040">22.404-5</a>(b)(2)). Once incorporated in a contract, a project wage determination normally remains effective for the life of the contract, unless the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of the contract (see <a href="#wp1102097">22.404-12</a>).

(1) <em class="cEmphasis">Building </em>construction is generally the construction of sheltered enclosures with walk-in access, for housing persons, machinery, equipment, or supplies. It typically includes all construction of such structures, installation of utilities and equipment (both above and below grade level), as well as incidental grading, utilities and paving, unless there is an established area practice to the contrary.
      </p>
<a name="wp1102022"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) <em class="cEmphasis">Residential</em> construction is generally the construction, alteration, or repair of single family houses or apartment buildings of no more than four (4) stories in height, and typically includes incidental items such as site work, parking areas, utilities, streets and sidewalks, unless there is an established area practice to the contrary.
      </p>
<a name="wp1102023"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) <em class="cEmphasis">Highway </em>construction is generally the construction, alteration, or repair of roads, streets, highways, runways, taxiways, alleys, parking areas, and other similar projects that are not incidental to &ldquo;building,&rdquo; &ldquo;residential,&rdquo; or &ldquo;heavy&rdquo; construction.
      </p>
<a name="wp1102024"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) <em class="cEmphasis">Heavy</em> construction includes those projects that are not properly classified as either &ldquo;building,&rdquo; &ldquo;residential,&rdquo; or &ldquo;highway,&rdquo; and is of a catch-all nature. Such heavy projects may sometimes be distinguished on the basis of their individual characteristics, and separate schedules issued (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g.</em>,&ldquo;dredging,&rdquo; &ldquo;water and sewer line,&rdquo; &ldquo;dams,&rdquo; &ldquo;flood control,&rdquo; etc.).
      </p>
<a name="wp1102025"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) When the nature of a project is not clear, it is necessary to look at additional factors, with primary consideration given to locally established area practices. If there is any doubt as to the proper application of wage rate schedules to the type or types of construction involved, guidance shall be sought before the opening of bids, or receipt of best and final offers, from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division. Further examples are contained in Department of Labor All Agency Memoranda Numbers 130 and 131.</p>

22.404-3  Procedures for requesting wage determinations.</h3>
<a name="wp1107198"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) General wage determinations. If there is a general wage determination on the WDOL website applicable to the project, the agency may use it without notifying the Department of Labor.

(1) The time required by the Department of Labor for processing requests for project wage determinations varies according to the facts and circumstances in each case. An agency should expect the processing to take at least 30 days. Accordingly, agencies should submit requests for project wage determinations for the primary site of the work to the Department of Labor at least 45 days (60 days if possible) before issuing the solicitation or exercising an option to extend the term of a contract.</p>

<a name="wp1102043"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) If a project wage determination for the primary site of the work expires before bid opening, or if it appears before bid opening that a project wage determination may expire before award, the contracting officer shall request a new determination early enough to ensure its receipt before bid opening. If necessary, the contracting officer shall postpone the bid opening date to allow a reasonable time to obtain the determination, amend the solicitation to incorporate the new determination, and permit bidders to amend their bids. If the new determination does not change the wage rates and would not warrant amended bids, the contracting officer shall amend the solicitation to include the number and date of the new determination.</p>
<a name="wp1102044"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If a project wage determination for the primary site of the work expires after bid opening but before award, the contracting officer shall request an extension of the project wage determination expiration date from the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division.

If necessary, the contracting officer shall delay award to permit either receipt of the extension or receipt and processing of a new determination. If the request is granted, the contracting officer shall award the contract and modify it to apply the extended expiration date to the already incorporated project wage determination.

(2) The contracting officer need not delay opening and reviewing proposals or discussing them with the offerors while a new determination for the primary site of the work is being obtained.

(2) All project wage determination modifications expire on the same day as the original determination. The need to include a modification of a project wage determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the time of receipt of the modification by the contracting agency.

<a name="wp1107220"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The need for inclusion of the modification of a general wage determination for the primary site of the work in a solicitation is determined by the date the modified wage determination is published on the WDOL, or by the date the agency receives actual written notice of the modification from the Department of Labor, whichever occurs first. (Note the distinction between receipt by the agency (modification is effective) and receipt by the contracting officer, which may occur later.) During the course of the solicitation, the contracting officer shall monitor the WDOL website to determine whether the applicable wage determination has been revised. Revisions published on the WDOL website or otherwise communicated to the contracting officer within the timeframes prescribed at <a href="#wp1102052">22.404-6</a>(b) and (c) are applicable and must be included in the resulting contract.

22.404-12  Labor standards for contracts containing construction requirements and option provisions that extend the term of the contract.</h3>
<a name="wp1102098"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Each time the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of a contract for construction, or a contract that includes substantial and segregable construction work, the contracting officer must modify the contract to incorporate the most current wage determination.</p>
<a name="wp1102099"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) If a contract with an option to extend the term of the contract has indefinite-delivery or indefinite-quantity construction requirements, the contracting officer must incorporate the wage determination incorporated into the contract at the exercise of the option into task orders issued during that option period. The wage determination will be effective for the complete period of performance of those task orders without further revision.</p>
<a name="wp1102100"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The contracting officer must include in fixed-price contracts a clause that specifies one of the following methods, suitable to the interest of the Government, to provide an allowance for any increases or decreases in labor costs that result from the inclusion of the current wage determination at the exercise of an option to extend the term of the contract:</p>
<a name="wp1102101"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The contracting officer may provide the offerors the opportunity to bid or propose separate prices for each option period. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is used in construction-only contracts (with options to extend the term) that are not expected to exceed a total of 3 years.</p>
<a name="wp1109340"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The contracting officer may include in the contract a separately specified pricing method that permits an adjustment to the contract price or contract labor unit price at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. At the time of option exercise, the contracting officer must incorporate a new wage determination into the contract, and must apply the specific pricing method to calculate the contract price adjustment. An example of a contract pricing method that the contracting officer might separately specify is incorporation in the solicitation and resulting contract of the pricing data from an annually published unit pricing book <em class="cEmphasis">(e.g.</em>, the U.S. Army Computer-Aided Cost Estimating System or similar commercial product), which is multiplied in the contract by a factor proposed by the contractor (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g.</em>, .95 or 1.1). At option exercise, the contracting officer incorporates the pricing data from the latest annual edition of the unit pricing book, multiplied by the factor agreed to in the basic contract. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of the new or revised wage determination.
      </p>
<a name="wp1102103"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer may provide for a contract price adjustment based solely on a percentage rate determined by the contracting officer using a published economic indicator incorporated into the solicitation and resulting contract. At the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract, the contracting officer will apply the percentage rate, based on the economic indicator, to the portion of the contract price or contract unit price designated in the contract clause as labor costs subject to the provisions of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. The contracting officer must insert 50 percent as the estimated portion of the contract price that is labor unless the contracting officer determines, prior to issuance of the solicitation, that a different percentage is more appropriate for a particular contract or requirement. This percentage adjustment to the designated labor costs must be the only adjustment made to cover increases in wages and/or benefits resulting from the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option.</p>
<a name="wp1102104"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The contracting officer may provide a computation method to adjust the contract price to reflect the contractor&rsquo;s actual increase or decrease in wages and fringe benefits (combined) to the extent that the increase is made to comply with, or the decrease is voluntarily made by the contractor as a result of incorporation of, a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is appropriate for use only if contract requirements are predominately services subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the construction requirements are substantial and segregable. The methods used to adjust the contract price for the service requirements and the construction requirements would be similar.</p>

22.406-2  Wages, fringe benefits, and overtime.</h3>
<a name="wp1102116"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) In computing wages paid to a laborer or mechanic, the contractor may include only the following items:</p>
<a name="wp1102117"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Amounts paid in cash to the laborer or mechanic, or deducted from payments under the conditions set forth in 29 CFR 3.5.</p>
<a name="wp1102118"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Contributions (except those required by Federal, State, or local law) the contractor makes irrevocably to a trustee or a third party under any bona fide plan or program to provide for medical or hospital care, pensions, compensation for injuries or illness resulting from occupational activity, unemployment benefits, life insurance, disability and sickness insurance, accident insurance, or any other bona fide fringe benefit.</p>
<a name="wp1102119"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Other contributions or anticipated costs for bona fide fringe benefits to the extent expressly approved by the Secretary of Labor.</p>

(b)(1) The contractor may satisfy the obligation under the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1147505">52.222-6</a>, Construction Wage Rate Requirements, by providing wages consisting of any combination of contributions or costs as specified in paragraph (a) of this subsection, if the total cost of the combination is not less than the total of the basic hourly rate and fringe benefits payments prescribed in the wage determination for the classification of laborer or mechanic concerned.
      </p>
<a name="wp1102121"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Wages provided by the contractor and fringe benefits payments required by the wage determination may include items that are not stated as exact cash amounts. In these cases, the hourly cash equivalent of the cost of these items shall be determined by dividing the employer&rsquo;s contributions or costs by the employee&rsquo;s hours worked during the period covered by the costs or contributions. For example, if a contractor pays a monthly health insurance premium of $112 for a particular employee who worked 125 hours during the month, the hourly cash equivalent is determined by dividing $112 by 125 hours, which equals $0.90 per hour. Similarly, the calculation of hourly cash equivalent for nine paid holidays per year for an employee with a hourly rate of pay of $5.00 is determined by multiplying $5.00 by 72 (9 days at 8 hours each), and dividing the result of $360 by the number of hours worked by the employee during the year. If the interested parties (contractor, contracting officer, and employees or their representative) cannot agree on the cash equivalent, the contracting officer shall submit the question for final determination to the Department of Labor as prescribed by agency procedures. The information submitted shall include—</p>
<a name="wp1102122"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) A comparison of the payments, contributions, or costs in the wage determination with those made or proposed as equivalents by the contractor; and</p>

(ii) The comments and recommendations of the contracting officer.</p>
<a name="wp1102124"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) In computing required overtime payments, (<em class="cEmphasis">i.e., </em>1 1/2 times the basic hourly rate of pay) the contractor shall use the basic hourly rate of pay in the wage determination, or the basic hourly rate actually paid by the contractor, if higher. The basic rate of pay includes employee contributions to fringe benefits, but excludes the contractor&rsquo;s contributions, costs, or payment of cash equivalents for fringe benefits. Overtime shall not be computed on a rate lower than the basic hourly rate in the wage determination.
