16.401  General.</h3>

(a) Incentive contracts as described in this subpart are appropriate when a firm-fixed-price contract is not appropriate and the required supplies or services can be acquired at lower costs and, in certain instances, with improved delivery or technical performance, by relating the amount of profit or fee payable under the contract to the contractor&rsquo;s performance. Incentive contracts are designed to obtain specific acquisition objectives by—</p>
<a name="wp1078215"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Establishing reasonable and attainable targets that are clearly communicated to the contractor; and</p>
<a name="wp1078216"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Including appropriate incentive arrangements designed to—</p>
<a name="wp1078217"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) motivate contractor efforts that might not otherwise be emphasized; and</p>
<a name="wp1078218"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) discourage contractor inefficiency and waste.</p>
<a name="wp1078219"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) When predetermined, formula-type incentives on technical performance or delivery are included, increases in profit or fee are provided only for achievement that sur-passes the targets, and decreases are provided for to the extent that such targets are not met. The incentive increases or decreases are applied to performance targets rather than minimum performance requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1078220"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The two basic categories of incentive contracts are fixed-price incentive contracts (see <a href="#wp1078245">16.403</a> and <a href="#wp1078278">16.404</a>) and cost-reimbursement incentive contracts (see <a href="#wp1078287">16.405</a>). Since it is usually to the Government&rsquo;s advantage for the contractor to assume substantial cost responsibility and an appropriate share of the cost risk, fixed-price incentive contracts are preferred when contract costs and performance requirements are reasonably certain. Cost-reimbursement incentive contracts are subject to the overall limitations in <a href="Subpart%2016_3.html#wp1077349">16.301</a> that apply to all cost-reimbursement contracts.

(d) A determination and finding, signed by the head of the contracting activity, shall be completed for all incentive- and award-fee contracts justifying that the use of this type of contract is in the best interest of the Government.

(iii) Any additional administrative effort and cost required to monitor and evaluate performance are justified by the expected benefits as documented by a risk and cost benefit analysis to be included in the Determination and Findings referenced in <a href="#wp1078213">16.401</a>(e)(5)(iii).

Award fee shall not be earned if the contractor&rsquo;s overall cost, schedule, and technical performance in the aggregate is below satisfactory. The basis for all award-fee determinations shall be documented in the contract file to include, at a minimum, a determination that overall cost, schedule and technical performance in the aggregate is or is not at a satisfactory level. This determination and the methodology for determining the award fee are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government.

16.402-2  Performance incentives.</h3>
<a name="wp1078230"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Performance incentives may be considered in connection with specific product characteristics (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>a missile range, an aircraft speed, an engine thrust, or a vehicle maneuverability) or other specific elements of the contractor&rsquo;s performance. These incentives should be designed to relate profit or fee to results achieved by the contractor, compared with specified targets.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078231"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) To the maximum extent practicable, positive and negative performance incentives shall be considered in connection with service contracts for performance of objectively measurable tasks when quality of performance is critical and incentives are likely to motivate the contractor.</p>
<a name="wp1078232"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Technical performance incentives may be particularly appropriate in major systems contracts, both in development (when performance objectives are known and the fabrication of prototypes for test and evaluation is required) and in production (if improved performance is attainable and highly desirable to the Government).</p>
<a name="wp1078233"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Technical performance incentives may involve a variety of specific characteristics that contribute to the overall performance of the end item. Accordingly, the incentives on individual technical characteristics must be balanced so that no one of them is exaggerated to the detriment of the overall performance of the end item.</p>
<a name="wp1078234"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Performance tests and/or assessments of work performance are generally essential in order to determine the degree of attainment of performance targets. Therefore, the contract must be as specific as possible in establishing test criteria (such as testing conditions, instrumentation precision, and data interpretation) and performance standards (such as the quality levels of services to be provided).</p>
<a name="wp1078235"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Because performance incentives present complex problems in contract administration, the contracting officer should negotiate them in full coordination with Government engineering and pricing specialists.</p>
<a name="wp1078236"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) It is essential that the Government and contractor agree explicitly on the effect that contract changes (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>pursuant to the Changes clause) will have on performance incentives.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078237"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) The contracting officer must exercise care, in establishing performance criteria, to recognize that the contractor should not be rewarded or penalized for attainments of Government-furnished components.</p>

16.402-3  Delivery incentives.</h3>
<a name="wp1078239"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Delivery incentives should be considered when improvement from a required delivery schedule is a significant Government objective. It is important to determine the Government&rsquo;s primary objectives in a given contract (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>earliest possible delivery or earliest quantity production).
      </p>
<a name="wp1078240"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Incentive arrangements on delivery should specify the application of the reward-penalty structure in the event of Government-caused delays or other delays beyond the control, and without the fault or negligence, of the contractor or subcontractor.</p>

16.402-4  Structuring multiple-incentive contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1078242"> </a><p class="pBody">
A properly structured multiple-incentive arrangement should—</p>

(a) Motivate the contractor to strive for outstanding results in all incentive areas; and</p>
<a name="wp1078244"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Compel trade-off decisions among the incentive areas, consistent with the Government&rsquo;s overall objectives for the acquisition. Because of the interdependency of the Government&rsquo;s cost, the technical performance, and the delivery goals, a contract that emphasizes only one of the goals may jeopardize control over the others. Because outstanding results may not be attainable for each of the incentive areas, all multiple-incentive contracts must include a cost incentive (or constraint) that operates to preclude rewarding a contractor for superior technical performance or delivery results when the cost of those results outweighs their value to the Government.</p>

16.403  Fixed-price incentive contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1078246"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Description</em>. A fixed-price incentive contract is a fixed-price contract that provides for adjusting profit and establishing the final contract price by application of a formula based on the relationship of total final negotiated cost to total target cost. The final price is subject to a price ceiling, negotiated at the outset. The two forms of fixed-price incentive contracts, firm target and successive targets, are further described in <a href="#wp1078252">16.403-1</a> and <a href="#wp1078630">16.403-2</a> below.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078247"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Application</em>. A fixed-price incentive contract is appropriate when—
      </p>
<a name="wp1078248"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) A firm-fixed-price contract is not suitable;</p>
<a name="wp1078249"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The nature of the supplies or services being acquired and other circumstances of the acquisition are such that the contractor&rsquo;s assumption of a degree of cost responsibility will provide a positive profit incentive for effective cost control and performance; and</p>
<a name="wp1078250"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) If the contract also includes incentives on technical performance and/or delivery, the performance requirements provide a reasonable opportunity for the incentives to have a meaningful impact on the contractor&rsquo;s management of the work.</p>
<a name="wp1078251"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) <em class="cEmphasis">Billing prices</em>. In fixed-price incentive contracts, billing prices are established as an interim basis for payment. These billing prices may be adjusted, within the ceiling limits, upon request of either party to the contract, when it becomes apparent that final negotiated cost will be substantially different from the target cost.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078252"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
16.403-1  Fixed-price incentive (firm target) contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1078253"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Description</em>. A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract specifies a target cost, a target profit, a price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor), and a profit adjustment formula. These elements are all negotiated at the outset. The price ceiling is the maximum that may be paid to the contractor, except for any adjustment under other contract clauses. When the contractor completes performance, the parties negotiate the final cost, and the final price is established by applying the formula. When the final cost is less than the target cost, application of the formula results in a final profit greater than the target profit; conversely, when final cost is more than target cost, application of the formula results in a final profit less than the target profit, or even a net loss. If the final negotiated cost exceeds the price ceiling, the contractor absorbs the difference as a loss. Because the profit varies inversely with the cost, this contract type provides a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078254"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Application</em>. A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract is appropriate when the parties can negotiate at the outset a firm target cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula that will provide a fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk. When the contractor assumes a considerable or major share of the cost responsibility under the adjustment formula, the target profit should reflect this responsibility.

(2) When the production point specified in the contract is reached, the parties negotiate the firm target cost, giving consideration to cost experience under the contract and other pertinent factors.

(ii) If negotiation of a firm fixed price is inappropriate, they may negotiate a formula for establishing the final price using the firm target cost and firm target profit.

Award-fee provisions may be used in fixed-price contracts when the Government wishes to motivate a contractor and other incentives cannot be used because contractor performance cannot be measured objectively. Such contracts shall establish a fixed price (including normal profit) for the effort.  This price will be paid for satisfactory contract performance.  Award fee earned (if any) will be paid in addition to that fixed price. See <a href="#wp1078213">16.401</a>(e) for the requirements relative to utilizing this contract type.

16.405-1  Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1078290"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Description</em>. The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that provides for the initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs. This contract type specifies a target cost, a target fee, minimum and maximum fees, and a fee adjustment formula. After contract performance, the fee payable to the contractor is determined in accordance with the formula. The formula provides, within limits, for increases in fee above target fee when total allowable costs are less than target costs, and decreases in fee below target fee when total allowable costs exceed target costs. This increase or decrease is intended to provide an incentive for the contractor to manage the contract effectively. When total allowable cost is greater than or less than the range of costs within which the fee-adjustment formula operates, the contractor is paid total allowable costs, plus the minimum or maximum fee.

(2) The contract may include technical performance incentives when it is highly probable that the required development of a major system is feasible and the Government has established its performance objectives, at least in general terms. This approach also may apply to other acquisitions, if the use of both cost and technical performance incentives is desirable and administratively practical.</p>
<a name="wp1078296"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The fee adjustment formula should provide an incentive that will be effective over the full range of reasonably foreseeable variations from target cost.
