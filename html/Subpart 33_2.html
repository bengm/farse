As used in this subpart—</p>
<a name="wp1079865"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Accrual of a claim&rdquo; means the date when all events, that fix the alleged liability of either the Government or the contractor and permit assertion of the claim, were known or should have been known. For liability to be fixed, some injury must have occurred. However, monetary damages need not have been incurred.</p>
<a name="wp1079866"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Alternative dispute resolution (ADR)&rdquo; means any type of procedure or combination of procedures voluntarily used to resolve issues in controversy. These procedures may include, but are not limited to, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, fact-finding, minitrials, arbitration, and use of ombudsmen.</p>
<a name="wp1079867"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Defective certification&rdquo; means a certificate which alters or otherwise deviates from the language in <a href="#wp1079892">33.207</a>(c) or which is not executed by a person authorized to bind the contractor with respect to the claim. Failure to certify shall not be deemed to be a defective certification.
      </p>
<a name="wp1079868"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Issue in controversy&rdquo; means a material disagreement between the Government and the contractor that—</p>
<a name="wp1079869"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) May result in a claim; or</p>
<a name="wp1079870"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Is all or part of an existing claim.</p>
<a name="wp1079871"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Misrepresentation of fact&rdquo; means a false statement of substantive fact, or any conduct which leads to the belief of a substantive fact material to proper understanding of the matter in hand, made with intent to deceive or mislead.</p>

<a name="wp1079873"> </a><p class="pBody">
<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. chpater 71</a>, Disputes, establishes procedures and requirements for asserting and resolving claims subject to the Disputes statute.  In addition, the Disputes statute provides for—
      </p>
<a name="wp1079874"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The payment of interest on contractor claims;</p>
<a name="wp1079875"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Certification of contractor claims; and</p>

33.203  Applicability.</h3>
<a name="wp1079878"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, this part applies to any express or implied contract covered by the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<a name="wp1079879"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) This subpart does not apply to any contract with—</p>

(1) A foreign government or agency of that government; or</p>
<a name="wp1079881"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) An international organization or a subsidiary body of that organization, if the agency head determines that the application of the Disputes statute to the contract would not be in the public interest.</p>
<a name="wp1079882"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) This part applies to all disputes with respect to contracting officer decisions on matters &ldquo;arising under&rdquo; or &ldquo;relating to&rdquo; a contract. Agency Boards of Contract Appeals (BCAs) authorized under the Disputes statute continue to have all of the authority they possessed before the Disputes statute with respect to disputes arising under a contract, as well as authority to decide disputes relating to a contract.  The clause at <a href="52_233_240.html#wp1113304">52.233-1</a>, Disputes, Disputes, recognizes the &ldquo;all disputes&rdquo; authority established by the Disputes statute and states certain requirements and limitations of the Disputes statute for the guidance of contractors and contracting agencies.  The clause is not intended to affect the rights and obligations of the parties as provided by the Disputes statute or to constrain the authority of the statutory agency BCAs in the handling and deciding of contractor appeals under the Disputes statute.

<a name="wp1079883"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
33.204  Policy.</h3>
<a name="wp1079884"> </a><p class="pBody">
The Government&rsquo;s policy is to try to resolve all contractual issues in controversy by mutual agreement at the contracting officer&rsquo;s level. Reasonable efforts should be made to resolve controversies prior to the submission of a claim. Agencies are encouraged to use ADR procedures to the maximum extent practicable. Certain factors, however, may make the use of ADR inappropriate (see <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t05t08+2+3++%285%29%20%20AND">5 U.S.C. 572(b)</a>). Except for arbitration conducted pursuant to the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act (ADRA), (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t05t08+2+3++%285%29%20%20AND">5 U.S.C. 571</a>, <em class="cEmphasis">et seq</em>.) agencies have authority which is separate from that provided by the ADRA to use ADR procedures to resolve issues in controversy. Agencies may also elect to proceed under the authority and requirements of the ADRA.

33.205  Relationship of the Disputes statute to Pub. L. 85-804.</h3>
<a name="wp1079886"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Requests for relief under Public Law 85-804 (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t49t50+1360+76++%2850%29%20%20AND%20%28%2850%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">50 U.S.C. 1431-1435</a>) are not claims within the Disputes statute or the Disputes clause at <a href="52_233_240.html#wp1113304">52.233-1</a>, Disputes, and shall be processed under <a href="Subpart%2050_1.html#wp1079903">Subpart 50.1</a>, Extraordinary Contractual Actions. However, relief formerly available only under Public Law 85-804; <em class="cEmphasis">i.e., </em>legal entitlement to rescission or reformation for mutual mistake, is now available within the authority of the contracting officer under the Contract Disputes statute and the Disputes clause. In case of a question whether the contracting officer has authority to settle or decide specific types of claims, the contracting officer should seek legal advice.
      </p>
<a name="wp1079887"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) A contractor&rsquo;s allegation that it is entitled to rescission or reformation of its contract in order to correct or mitigate the effect of a mistake shall be treated as a claim under the Disputes statute. A contract may be reformed or rescinded by the contracting officer if the contractor would be entitled to such remedy or relief under the law of Federal contracts. Due to the complex legal issues likely to be associated with allegations of legal entitlement, contracting officers shall make written decisions, prepared with the advice and assistance of legal counsel, either granting or denying relief in whole or in part.</p>
<a name="wp1079888"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) A claim that is either denied or not approved in its entirety under paragraph (b) of this section may be cognizable as a request for relief under Public Law 85-804 as implemented by <a href="Subpart%2050_1.html#wp1079903">Subpart 50.1</a>. However, the claim must first be submitted to the contracting officer for consideration under the Disputes statute because the claim is not cognizable under Public Law 85-804, as implemented by <a href="Subpart%2050_1.html#wp1079903">Subpart 50.1</a>, unless other legal authority in the agency concerned is determined to be lacking or inadequate.

33.206  Initiation of a claim.</h3>
<a name="wp1079890"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Contractor claims shall be submitted, in writing, to the contracting officer for a decision within 6 years after accrual of a claim, unless the contracting parties agreed to a shorter time period. This 6-year time period does not apply to contracts awarded prior to October 1, 1995. The contracting officer shall document the contract file with evidence of the date of receipt of any submission from the contractor deemed to be a claim by the contracting officer.</p>
<a name="wp1079891"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contracting officer shall issue a written decision on any Government claim initiated against a contractor within 6 years after accrual of the claim, unless the contracting parties agreed to a shorter time period.

<a name="wp1079897"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The aggregate amount of both increased and decreased costs shall be used in determining when the dollar thresholds requiring certification are met (see example in <a href="Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1208430">15.403-4</a>(a)(1)(iii) regarding certified cost or pricing data).
      </p>
<a name="wp1079898"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) The certification may be executed by any person authorized to bind the contractor with respect to the claim.</p>

(See the clause at <a href="52_232.html#wp1152908">52.232-17</a> for the right of the Government to collect interest on its claims against a contractor.)
      </p>
<a name="wp1079905"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) With regard to claims having defective certifications, interest shall be paid from either the date that the contracting officer initially receives the claim or October 29, 1992, whichever is later.

33.209  Suspected fraudulent claims.</h3>
<a name="wp1079907"> </a><p class="pBody">
