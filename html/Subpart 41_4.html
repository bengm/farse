41.401  Monthly and annual review.</h3>
<a name="wp1074306"> </a><p class="pBody">
Agencies shall review utility service invoices on a monthly basis and all utility accounts with annual values exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold on an annual basis. Annual reviews of accounts with annual values at or below the simplified acquisition threshold shall be conducted when deemed advantageous to the Government. The purpose of the monthly review is to ensure the accuracy of utility service invoices. The purpose of the annual review is to ensure that the utility supplier is furnishing the services to each facility under the utility&rsquo;s most economical, applicable rate and to examine competitive markets for more advantageous service offerings. The annual review shall be based upon the facility&rsquo;s usage, conditions and characteristics of service at each individual delivery point for the most recent 12 months. If a more advantageous rate is appropriate, the Federal agency shall request the supplier to make such rate change immediately.</p>

(a) When a change is proposed to rates or terms and conditions of service to the Government, the agency shall promptly determine whether the proposed change is reasonable, justified, and not discriminatory.</p>

(b) If a change is proposed to rates or terms and conditions of service that may be of interest to other Federal agencies, and intervention before a regulatory body is considered justified, the matter shall be referred to GSA. The agency may request from GSA a delegation of authority for the agency to intervene on behalf of the consumer interests of the Federal executive agencies (see <a href="Subpart%2041_3.html#wp1074508">41.301</a>).

(c) Pursuant to <a href="52_241_244.html#wp1128714">52.241-7</a>, Change in Rates or Terms and Conditions of Service for Regulated Services, if a regulatory body approves a rate change, any rate change shall be made a part of the contract by unilateral contract modification or otherwise documented in accordance with agency procedures. The approved applicable rate shall be effective on the date determined by the regulatory body and resulting rates and charges shall be paid promptly to avoid late payment provisions. Copies of the modification containing the approved rate change shall be sent to the agency&rsquo;s paying office or office responsible for verifying billed amounts (see <a href="#wp1074305">41.401</a>).
