The contracting officer may set aside solicitations to allow only local firms within a specific geographic area to compete (see <a href="Subpart%206_2.html#wp1087633">6.208</a>).

26.203  Transition of work.</h3>
<a name="wp1054366"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) In anticipation of potential emergency response requirements, agencies involved in response planning should consider awarding emergency response contracts before a major disaster or emergency occurs to ensure immediate response and relief.  These contracts should be structured to respond to immediate emergency response needs, and should not be structured in any way that may inhibit the transition of emergency response work to local firms (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g.</em>, unnecessarily broad scopes of work or long periods of performance).
      </p>
<a name="wp1054367"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov">42 U.S.C. 5150(b)(2)</a> requires that agencies performing response, relief, and reconstruction activities  transition to local firms any work performed under contracts in effect on the date on which the President declares a major disaster or emergency, unless the head of such agency determines in writing that it is not feasible or practicable.  This determination may be made on an individual contract or class basis.  The written determination shall be prepared within a reasonable time given the circumstances of the emergency.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054368"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) In effecting the transition, agencies are not required to terminate or renegotiate existing contracts.  Agencies should transition the work at the earliest practical opportunity after consideration of the following:</p>
<a name="wp1054369"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The potential duration of the disaster or emergency. </p>
<a name="wp1054370"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The severity of the disaster or emergency.</p>
<a name="wp1054371"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The scope and structure of the existing contract, including its period of performance and the milestone(s) at which a transition is reasonable (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g.</em>, before exercising an option).
      </p>
<a name="wp1054372"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The potential impact of a transition, including safety, national defense, and mobilization.</p>
<a name="wp1054373"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) The expected availability of qualified local offerors who can provide the products or services at a reasonable price.</p>
<a name="wp1054374"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The agency shall transition the work to local firms using the local area set-aside identified in <a href="#wp1054387">26.202-1</a>.

26.204  Justification for expenditures to other than local firms.</h3>
<a name="wp1054713"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov">42 U.S.C. 5150(b)(1)</a> requires that, subsequent to any Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency, any expenditure of Federal funds, under an emergency response contract not awarded to a local firm, must be justified in writing in the contract file.  The justification should include consideration for the scope of the major disaster or emergency and the immediate requirements or needs of supplies and services to ensure life is protected, victims are cared for, and property is protected.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054778"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The justification may be made on an individual or class basis.  The contracting officer approves the justification.</p>

26.205  Disaster Response Registry.</h3>
<a name="wp1054821"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Contracting officers shall consult the Disaster Response Registry via <a target="_blank" href="https://www.acquisition.gov">https://www.acquisition.gov</a> to determine the availability of contractors for debris removal, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other disaster or emergency relief activities inside the United States and outlying areas.
