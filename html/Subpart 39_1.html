39.102  Management of risk.</h3>
<a name="wp1096825"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Prior to entering into a contract for information technology, an agency should analyze risks, benefits, and costs. (See <a href="FARTOCP07.html#wp273907">Part 7</a> for additional information regarding requirements definition.) Reasonable risk taking is appropriate as long as risks are controlled and mitigated. Contracting and program office officials are jointly responsible for assessing, monitoring and controlling risk when selecting projects for investment and during program implementation.
      </p>
<a name="wp1096826"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Types of risk may include schedule risk, risk of technical obsolescence, cost risk, risk implicit in a particular contract type, technical feasibility, dependencies between a new project and other projects or systems, the number of simultaneous high risk projects to be monitored, funding availability, and program management risk.</p>
<a name="wp1096827"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Appropriate techniques should be applied to manage and mitigate risk during the acquisition of information technology. Techniques include, but are not limited to: prudent project management; use of modular contracting; thorough acquisition planning tied to budget planning by the program, finance and contracting offices; continuous collection and evaluation of risk-based assessment data; prototyping prior to implementation; post implementation reviews to determine actual project cost, benefits and returns; and focusing on risks and returns using quantifiable measures.</p>
<a name="wp1096828"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
39.103  Modular contracting.</h3>
<a name="wp1096829"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) This section implements <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 2308</a>. Modular contracting is intended to reduce program risk and to incentivize contractor performance while meeting the Government&rsquo;s need for timely access to rapidly changing technology. Consistent with the agency&rsquo;s information technology architecture, agencies should, to the maximum extent practicable, use modular contracting to acquire major systems (see <a href="Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145508">2.101</a>) of information technology. Agencies may also use modular contracting to acquire non-major systems of information technology.
      </p>
<a name="wp1096830"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) When using modular contracting, an acquisition of a system of information technology may be divided into several smaller acquisition increments that—</p>
<a name="wp1096831"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Are easier to manage individually than would be possible in one comprehensive acquisition;</p>
<a name="wp1096832"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Address complex information technology objectives incrementally in order to enhance the likelihood of achieving workable systems or solutions for attainment of those objectives;</p>
<a name="wp1096833"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Provide for delivery, implementation, and testing of workable systems or solutions in discrete increments, each of which comprises a system or solution that is not dependent on any subsequent increment in order to perform its principal functions;</p>
<a name="wp1096834"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Provide an opportunity for subsequent increments to take advantage of any evolution in technology or needs that occur during implementation and use of the earlier increments; and</p>
<a name="wp1096835"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Reduce risk of potential adverse consequences on the overall project by isolating and avoiding custom-designed components of the system.</p>
<a name="wp1096836"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The characteristics of an increment may vary depending upon the type of information technology being acquired and the nature of the system being developed. The following factors may be considered:</p>
<a name="wp1096837"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) To promote compatibility, the information technology acquired through modular contracting for each increment should comply with common or commercially acceptable information technology standards when available and appropriate, and shall conform to the agency&rsquo;s master information technology architecture.</p>
<a name="wp1096838"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The performance requirements of each increment should be consistent with the performance requirements of the completed, overall system within which the information technology will function and should address interface requirements with succeeding increments.</p>
<a name="wp1096839"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) For each increment, contracting officers shall choose an appropriate contracting technique that facilitates the acquisition of subsequent increments. Pursuant to <a href="FARTOCP16.html#wp226194">Parts 16</a> and <a href="FARTOCP17.html#wp223561">17</a> of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, contracting officers shall select the contract type and method appropriate to the circumstances (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts, single contract with options, successive contracts, multiple awards, task order contracts). Contract(s) shall be structured to ensure that the Government is not required to procure additional increments.
      </p>
<a name="wp1096840"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) To avoid obsolescence, a modular contract for information technology should, to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded within 180 days after the date on which the solicitation is issued. If award cannot be made within 180 days, agencies should consider cancellation of the solicitation in accordance with <a href="Subpart%2014_2.html#wp1096840">14.209</a> or <a href="Subpart%2015_2.html#wp1125408">15.206</a>(e). To the maximum extent practicable, deliveries under the contract should be scheduled to occur within 18 months after issuance of the solicitation.

39.104  Information technology services.</h3>
<a name="wp1096842"> </a><p class="pBody">
When acquiring information technology services, solicitations must not describe any minimum experience or educational requirement for proposed contractor personnel unless the contracting officer determines that the needs of the agency—</p>

(a) Cannot be met without that requirement; or</p>

39.105  Privacy.</h3>

In addition, each agency shall ensure that contracts for the design, development, or operation of a system of records using commercial information technology services or information technology support services include the following:
      </p>
<a name="wp1096847"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Agency rules of conduct that the contractor and the contractor&rsquo;s employees shall be required to follow.</p>

39.106  Contract clause.</h3>
