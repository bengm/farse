13.500  General.</h3>

(a) This subpart authorizes the use of simplified procedures for the acquisition of supplies and services in amounts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold but not exceeding $7 million ($13 million for acquisitions as described in 13.500(c)), including options, if the contracting officer reasonably expects, based on the nature of the supplies or services sought, and on market research, that offers will include only commercial items. Contracting officers may use any simplified acquisition procedure in this part, subject to any specific dollar limitation applicable to the particular procedure.  The purpose of these simplified procedures is to vest contracting officers with additional procedural discretion and flexibility, so that commercial item acquisitions in this dollar range may be solicited, offered, evaluated, and awarded in a simplified manner that maximizes efficiency and economy and minimizes burden and administrative costs for both the Government and industry (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">10 U.S.C. 2304(g)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">2305</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 3305</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">3306</a>, and chapter 37, Awarding of Contracts.
