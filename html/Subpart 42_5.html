42.501  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1076239"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A postaward orientation aids both Government and contractor personnel to (1) achieve a clear and mutual understanding of all contract requirements, and (2) identify and resolve potential problems. However, it is not a substitute for the contractor&rsquo;s fully understanding the work requirements at the time offers are submitted, nor is it to be used to alter the final agreement arrived at in any negotiations leading to contract award.</p>

The chairperson of the conference shall conduct the meeting.

The contracting officer may make commitments or give directions within the scope of the contracting officer&rsquo;s authority and shall put in writing and sign any commitment or direction, whether or not it changes the contract. Any change to the contract that results from the postaward conference shall be made only by a contract modification referencing the applicable terms of the contract. Participants without authority to bind the Government shall not take action that in any way alters the contract. The chairperson shall include in the summary report (see <a href="#wp1075625">42.503-3</a>) all information and guidance provided to the contractor.
