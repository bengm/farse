<a name="wp1107321"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Contracting officers may obtain most prevailing wage determinations using the WDOL website. Contracting officers may also use the Department of Labor&rsquo;s e98 electronic process, located on the WDOL website, to request a wage determination directly from the Department of Labor. If the WDOL database does not contain the applicable prevailing wage determination for a contract action, the contracting officer must use the e98 process to request a wage determination from the Department of Labor.</p>
<a name="wp1107322"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) In using the e98 process to obtain prevailing wage determinations, contracting officers shall provide as complete and accurate information on the e98 as possible. Contracting officers shall ensure that the email address submitted on an e98 request is accurate.</p>
<a name="wp1107323"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The contracting officer must anticipate the amount of time required to gather the information necessary to obtain a wage determination, including sufficient time, if necessary, to contact the Department of Labor to request wage determinations that are not available through use of the WDOL.</p>
<a name="wp1107324"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Although the WDOL website provides assistance to the contracting agency to select the correct wage determination, the contracting agency remains responsible for the wage determination selected. If the contracting agency has used the e98 process, the Department of Labor will respond to the contracting agency based on the information provided on the e98. The contracting agency may rely upon the Department of Labor response as the correct wage determination for the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1107325"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) To obtain the applicable wage determination for each contract action, the contracting officer shall determine the following information concerning the service employees expected to be employed by the contractor and any subcontractors in performing the contract:</p>
<a name="wp1107326"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Determine the classes of service employees to be utilized in performance of the contract using the Wage and Hour Division&rsquo;s <em class="cEmphasis">Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations</em> (Directory).

(c) The application of <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 6707(c)</a> is subject to the following limitations:

(2) If the incumbent contractor enters into a new or revised collective bargaining agreement during the period of the incumbent&rsquo;s performance on the current contract, the terms of the new or revised agreement shall not be effective for the purposes of <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 6707(c)</a> under the following conditions:

(i)(A) In sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify bidders (see <a href="#wp1105142">22.1002-2</a>(a)); or

(B) For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement after award, provided that the start of performance is within 30 days of award (see <a href="#wp1105142">22.1002-2</a>(b)); and
      </p>
<a name="wp1105291"> </a><p class="pIndented2">

(d)(1) If <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 6707(c)</a> applies, the contracting officer shall obtain a copy of any collective bargaining agreement between an incumbent contractor or subcontractor and its employees. Obtaining a copy of an incumbent contractor&rsquo;s collective bargaining agreement may involve coordination with the administrative contracting officer responsible for administering the predecessor contract. (Paragraph (m) of the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1160021">52.222-41</a>, Service Contract Labor Standards, requires the incumbent prime contractor to furnish the contracting officer a copy of each collective bargaining agreement.)

<a name="wp1107447"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If the contracting officer has timely received the collective bargaining agreement, the contracting officer may use the WDOL website to prepare a wage determination referencing the agreement and incorporate that wage determination, attached to a complete copy of the collective bargaining agreement, into the successor contract action. In using the WDOL process, it is not necessary to submit a copy of the collective bargaining agreement to the Department of Labor unless requested to do so.</p>
<a name="wp1107448"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer may also use the e98 process on WDOL to request that the Department of Labor prepare the cover wage determination. The Department of Labor&rsquo;s response to the e98 may include a request for the contracting officer to submit a complete copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Any questions regarding the applicability of the Service Contract Labor Standards statute to a collective bargaining agreement should be directed to the agency labor advisor.</p>

(e)(1) <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 6707(c)</a> will not apply if the Secretary of Labor determines (i) after a hearing, that the wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor&rsquo;s collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a similar character in the locality, or (ii) that the wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor&rsquo;s collective bargaining agreement are not the result of arm&rsquo;s length negotiations (see <a href="#wp1105385">22.1013</a> and <a href="#wp1105414">22.1021</a>). The Department of Labor (DOL) has concluded that contingent collective bargaining agreement provisions that attempt to limit a contractor&rsquo;s obligations by means such as requiring issuance of a wage determination by the DOL, requiring inclusion of the wage determination in the contract, or requiring the Government to adequately reimburse the contractor, generally reflect a lack of arm&rsquo;s length negotiations.

(2) If the contracting officer&rsquo;s review (see <a href="#wp1105385">22.1013</a>) indicates that monetary provisions of the collective bargaining agreement may be substantially at variance or may not have been reached as a result of arm&rsquo;s length bargaining, the contracting officer shall immediately contact the agency labor advisor to consider if further action is warranted.

Helpers in skilled maintenance trades (for example, electricians, machinists, and automobile mechanics) whose duties constitute, in fact, separate and distinct jobs may also be used if listed on the wage determination, but may not be conformed. Conformance may not be used to artificially split or subdivide classifications listed in the wage determination. However, conforming procedures may be used if the work which an employee performs under the contract is not within the scope of any classification listed on the wage determination, regardless of job title.
