31.201-1  Composition of total cost.</h3>
<a name="wp1102526"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The total cost, including standard costs properly adjusted for applicable variances, of a contract is the sum of the direct and indirect costs allocable to the contract, incurred or to be incurred, plus any allocable cost of money pursuant to <a href="#wp1095806">31.205-10</a>, less any allocable credits. In ascertaining what constitutes a cost, any generally accepted method of determining or estimating costs that is equitable and is consistently applied may be used.
      </p>
<a name="wp1095556"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) While the total cost of a contract includes all costs properly allocable to the contract, the allowable costs to the Government are limited to those allocable costs which are allowable pursuant to <a href="FARTOCP31.html#wp253693">Part 31</a> and applicable agency supplements.

31.201-2  Determining allowability.</h3>
<a name="wp1095558"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A cost is allowable only when the cost complies with all of the following requirements:</p>
<a name="wp1095559"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Reasonableness.</p>
<a name="wp1095560"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Allocability.</p>
<a name="wp1095561"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Standards promulgated by the CAS Board, if applicable, otherwise, generally accepted accounting principles and practices appropriate to the circumstances.</p>

(4) Terms of the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1095563"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Any limitations set forth in this subpart.</p>
<a name="wp1095564"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Certain cost principles in this subpart incorporate the measurement, assignment, and allocability rules of selected CAS and limit the allowability of costs to the amounts determined using the criteria in those selected standards. Only those CAS or portions of standards specifically made applicable by the cost principles in this subpart are mandatory unless the contract is CAS-covered (see <a href="FARTOCP30.html#wp223482">Part 30</a>). Business units that are not otherwise subject to these standards under a CAS clause are subject to the selected standards only for the purpose of determining allowability of costs on Government contracts. Including the selected standards in the cost principles does not subject the business unit to any other CAS rules and regulations. The applicability of the CAS rules and regulations is determined by the CAS clause, if any, in the contract and the requirements of the standards themselves.

(c) When contractor accounting practices are inconsistent with this <a href="#wp1095552">subpart 31.2</a>, costs resulting from such inconsistent practices in excess of the amount that would have resulted from using practices consistent with this subpart are unallowable.
      </p>
<a name="wp1095566"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) A contractor is responsible for accounting for costs appropriately and for maintaining records, including supporting documentation, adequate to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the contract, and comply with applicable cost principles in this subpart and agency supplements. The contracting officer may disallow all or part of a claimed cost that is inadequately supported.</p>
<a name="wp1095567"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
31.201-3  Determining reasonableness.</h3>
<a name="wp1095568"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A cost is reasonable if, in its nature and amount, it does not exceed that which would be incurred by a prudent person in the conduct of competitive business. Reasonableness of specific costs must be examined with particular care in connection with firms or their separate divisions that may not be subject to effective competitive restraints. No presumption of reasonableness shall be attached to the incurrence of costs by a contractor. If an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of a specific cost by the contracting officer or the contracting officer&rsquo;s representative, the burden of proof shall be upon the contractor to establish that such cost is reasonable.</p>
<a name="wp1095569"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) What is reasonable depends upon a variety of considerations and circumstances, including—</p>
<a name="wp1095570"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Whether it is the type of cost generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor&rsquo;s business or the contract performance;</p>
<a name="wp1095571"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Generally accepted sound business practices, arm&rsquo;s-length bargaining, and Federal and State laws and regulations;</p>
<a name="wp1095572"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contractor&rsquo;s responsibilities to the Government, other customers, the owners of the business, employees, and the public at large; and</p>
<a name="wp1095573"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Any significant deviations from the contractor&rsquo;s established practices.</p>

31.201-4  Determining allocability.</h3>
<a name="wp1095575"> </a><p class="pBody">
A cost is allocable if it is assignable or chargeable to one or more cost objectives on the basis of relative benefits received or other equitable relationship. Subject to the foregoing, a cost is allocable to a Government contract if it—</p>
<a name="wp1095576"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Is incurred specifically for the contract;</p>
<a name="wp1095577"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Benefits both the contract and other work, and can be distributed to them in reasonable proportion to the benefits received; or</p>
<a name="wp1095578"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Is necessary to the overall operation of the business, although a direct relationship to any particular cost objective cannot be shown.</p>

31.201-5  Credits.</h3>
<a name="wp1102494"> </a><p class="pBody">
The applicable portion of any income, rebate, allowance, or other credit relating to any allowable cost and received by or accruing to the contractor shall be credited to the Government either as a cost reduction or by cash refund. See <a href="#wp1095659">31.205-6</a>(j)(3) for rules governing refund or credit to the Government associated with pension adjustments and asset reversions.

31.201-6  Accounting for unallowable costs.</h3>
<a name="wp1095582"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Costs that are expressly unallowable or mutually agreed to be unallowable, including mutually agreed to be unallowable directly associated costs, shall be identified and excluded from any billing, claim, or proposal applicable to a Government contract. A directly associated cost is any cost that is generated solely as a result of incurring another cost, and that would not have been incurred had the other cost not been incurred. When an unallowable cost is incurred, its directly associated costs are also unallowable.</p>
<a name="wp1095583"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Costs that specifically become designated as unallowable or as unallowable directly associated costs of unallowable costs as a result of a written decision furnished by a contracting officer shall be identified if included in or used in computing any billing, claim, or proposal applicable to a Government contract. This identification requirement applies also to any costs incurred for the same purpose under like circumstances as the costs specifically identified as unallowable under either this paragraph or paragraph (a) of this subsection.</p>
<a name="wp1101018"> </a><p class="pDefault">
(c)(1) The practices for accounting for and presentation of unallowable costs must be those described in 48 CFR 9904.405, Accounting for Unallowable Costs.</p>
<a name="wp1101019"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Statistical sampling is an acceptable practice for contractors to follow in accounting for and presenting unallowable costs provided the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(2)(iii) of this subsection are met:</p>
<a name="wp1101020"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) The statistical sampling results in an unbiased sample that is a reasonable representation of the sampling universe.</p>
<a name="wp1101021"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Any large dollar value or high risk transaction is separately reviewed for unallowable costs and excluded from the sampling process.</p>
<a name="wp1101022"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) The statistical sampling permits audit verification.</p>
<a name="wp1101023"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) For any indirect cost in the selected sample that is subject to the penalty provisions at <a href="Subpart%2042_7.html#wp1084730">42.709-0</a>, the amount projected to the sampling universe from that sampled cost is also subject to the same penalty provisions.
      </p>
<a name="wp1101024"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Use of statistical sampling methods for identifying and segregating unallowable costs should be the subject of an advance agreement under the provisions of <a href="Subpart%2031_1.html#wp1089616">31.109</a> between the contractor and the cognizant administrative contracting officer or Federal official. The advance agreement should specify the basic characteristics of the sampling process. The cognizant administrative contracting officer or Federal official shall request input from the cognizant auditor before entering into any such agreements.
      </p>
<a name="wp1101025"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) In the absence of an advance agreement, if an initial review of the facts results in a challenge of the statistical sampling methods by the contracting officer or the contracting officer&rsquo;s representative, the burden of proof shall be on the contractor to establish that such a method meets the criteria in paragraph (c)(2) of this subsection.</p>
<a name="wp1095585"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) If a directly associated cost is included in a cost pool that is allocated over a base that includes the unallowable cost with which it is associated, the directly associated cost shall remain in the cost pool. Since the unallowable costs will attract their allocable share of costs from the cost pool, no further action is required to assure disallowance of the directly associated costs. In all other cases, the directly associated costs, if material in amount, must be purged from the cost pool as unallowable costs.</p>
<a name="wp1095586"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e)(1) In determining the materiality of a directly associated cost, consideration should be given to the significance of—</p>
<a name="wp1095587"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) The actual dollar amount,</p>
<a name="wp1095588"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The cumulative effect of all directly associated costs in a cost pool, and</p>
<a name="wp1095589"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) The ultimate effect on the cost of Government contracts.</p>
<a name="wp1095590"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Salary expenses of employees who participate in activities that generate unallowable costs shall be treated as directly associated costs to the extent of the time spent on the proscribed activity, provided the costs are material in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this subsection (except when such salary expenses are, themselves, unallowable). The time spent in proscribed activities should be compared to total time spent on company activities to determine if the costs are material. Time spent by employees outside the normal working hours should not be considered except when it is evident that an employee engages so frequently in company activities during periods outside normal working hours as to indicate that such activities are a part of the employee&rsquo;s regular duties.</p>
<a name="wp1095591"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) When a selected item of cost under <a href="#wp1095619">31.205</a> provides that directly associated costs be unallowable, such directly associated costs are unallowable only if determined to be material in amount in accordance with the criteria provided in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this subsection, except in those situations where allowance of any of the directly associated costs involved would be considered to be contrary to public policy.

31.201-7  Construction and architect-engineer contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1095593"> </a><p class="pBody">
Specific principles and procedures for evaluating and determining costs in connection with contracts and subcontracts for construction, and architect-engineer contracts related to construction projects, are in <a href="Subpart%2031_1.html#wp1089573">31.105</a>. The applicability of these principles and procedures is set forth in <a href="Subpart%2031_1.html#wp1089470">31.000</a> and <a href="Subpart%2031_1.html#wp1089548">31.100</a>.

31.202  Direct costs.</h3>
<a name="wp1095595"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) No final cost objective shall have allocated to it as a direct cost any cost, if other costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances have been included in any indirect cost pool to be allocated to that or any other final cost objective. Direct costs of the contract shall be charged directly to the contract. All costs specifically identified with other final cost objectives of the contractor are direct costs of those cost objectives and are not to be charged to the contract directly or indirectly.</p>
<a name="wp1095596"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) For reasons of practicality, the contractor may treat any direct cost of a minor dollar amount as an indirect cost if the accounting treatment—</p>
<a name="wp1095597"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Is consistently applied to all final cost objectives; and</p>
<a name="wp1095598"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Produces substantially the same results as treating the cost as a direct cost.</p>
<a name="wp1095599"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
31.203  Indirect costs.</h3>
<a name="wp1095600"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) For contracts subject to full CAS coverage, allocation of indirect costs shall be based on the applicable provisions. For all other contracts, the applicable CAS provisions in paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section apply.</p>
<a name="wp1095601"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) After direct costs have been determined and charged directly to the contract or other work, indirect costs are those remaining to be allocated to intermediate or two or more final cost objectives. No final cost objective shall have allocated to it as an indirect cost any cost, if other costs incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, have been included as a direct cost of that or any other final cost objective.</p>
<a name="wp1095602"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The contractor shall accumulate indirect costs by logical cost groupings with due consideration of the reasons for incurring such costs. The contractor shall determine each grouping so as to permit use of an allocation base that is common to all cost objectives to which the grouping is to be allocated. The base selected shall allocate the grouping on the basis of the benefits accruing to intermediate and final cost objectives. When substantially the same results can be achieved through less precise methods, the number and composition of cost groupings should be governed by practical considerations and should not unduly complicate the allocation.</p>
<a name="wp1095603"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Once an appropriate base for allocating indirect costs has been accepted, the contractor shall not fragment the base by removing individual elements. All items properly includable in an indirect cost base shall bear a pro rata share of indirect costs irrespective of their acceptance as Government contract costs. For example, when a cost input base is used for the allocation of G&amp;A costs, the contractor shall include in the base all items that would properly be part of the cost input base, whether allowable or unallowable, and these items shall bear their pro rata share of G&amp;A costs.</p>
<a name="wp1095604"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) The method of allocating indirect costs may require revision when there is a significant change in the nature of the business, the extent of subcontracting, fixed-asset improvement programs, inventories, the volume of sales and production, manufacturing processes, the contractor&rsquo;s products, or other relevant circumstances.</p>
<a name="wp1095605"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Separate cost groupings for costs allocable to offsite locations may be necessary to permit equitable distribution of costs on the basis of the benefits accruing to the several cost objectives.</p>
<a name="wp1095606"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) A base period for allocating indirect costs is the cost accounting period during which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to work performed in that period.</p>
<a name="wp1095607"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) For contracts subject to full or modified CAS coverage, the contractor shall follow the criteria and guidance in 48 CFR 9904.406 for selecting the cost accounting periods to be used in allocating indirect costs.</p>
<a name="wp1095608"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) For contracts other than those subject to paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the base period for allocating indirect costs shall be the contractor&rsquo;s fiscal year used for financial reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The fiscal year will normally be 12 months, but a different period may be appropriate (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>when a change in fiscal year occurs due to a business combination or other circumstances).

<a name="wp1095609"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) Special care should be exercised in applying the principles of paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section when Government-owned contractor-operated (GOCO) plants are involved. The distribution of corporate, division or branch office G&amp;A expenses to such plants operating with little or no dependence on corporate administrative activities may require more precise cost groupings, detailed accounts screening, and carefully developed distribution bases.</p>

(d) Section <a href="#wp1095619">31.205</a> does not cover every element of cost. Failure to include any item of cost does not imply that it is either allowable or unallowable.

When more than one subsection in <a href="#wp1095619">31.205</a> is relevant to a contractor cost, the cost shall be apportioned among the applicable subsections, and the determination of allowability of each portion shall be based on the guidance contained in the applicable subsection. When a cost, to which more than one subsection in <a href="#wp1095619">31.205</a> is relevant, cannot be apportioned, the determination of allowability shall be based on the guidance contained in the subsection that most specifically deals with, or best captures the essential nature of, the cost at issue.

The application of the provisions of a labor-management agreement designed to apply to a given set of circumstances and conditions of employment (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>work involving extremely hazardous activities or work not requiring recurrent use of overtime) is unwarranted when applied to a Government contract involving significantly different circumstances and conditions of employment (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>work involving less hazardous activities or work continually requiring use of overtime).
