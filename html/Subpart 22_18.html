Bulk cargo loaded into intermodal equipment, except LASH or Seabee barges, is subject to mark and count and, therefore, ceases to be bulk cargo.

<a name="wp1090087"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Statutes and Executive orders require employers to abide by the immigration laws of the United States and to employ in the United States only individuals who are eligible to work in the United States. The E-Verify program provides an Internet-based means of verifying employment eligibility of workers employed in the United States, but is not a substitute for any other employment eligibility verification requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1090088"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracting officers shall include in solicitations and contracts, as prescribed at <a href="#wp1089948">22.1803</a>, requirements that Federal contractors must—

(1) Enroll as Federal contractors in E-Verify; </p>
<a name="wp1090090"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

<a name="wp1090097"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Construction.</p>
<a name="wp1090385"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Contractors may elect to verify employment eligibility of all existing employees working in the United States who were hired after November 6, 1986 (after November 27, 2009, in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) instead of just those employees assigned to the contract.  The contractor is not required to verify employment eligibility of—</p>

<a name="wp1090102"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) DHS and the Social Security Administration (SSA) may terminate a contractor&rsquo;s MOU and deny access to the E-Verify system in accordance with the terms of the MOU.  If DHS or SSA terminates a contractor&rsquo;s MOU, the terminating agency must refer the contractor to a suspension or debarment official for possible suspension or debarment action.  During the period between termination of the MOU and a decision by the suspension or debarment official whether to suspend or debar, the contractor is excused from its obligations under paragraph (b) of the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1156645">52.222-54</a>.  If the contractor is suspended or debarred as a result of the MOU termination, the contractor is not eligible to participate in E-Verify during the period of its suspension or debarment.  If the suspension or debarment official determines not to suspend or debar the contractor, then the contractor must reenroll in E-Verify.
