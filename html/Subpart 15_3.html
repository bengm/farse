15.305  Proposal evaluation.</h3>
<a name="wp1088904"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposal and the offeror&rsquo;s ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. An agency shall evaluate competitive proposals and then assess their relative qualities solely on the factors and subfactors specified in the solicitation. Evaluations may be conducted using any rating method or combination of methods, including color or adjectival ratings, numerical weights, and ordinal rankings. The relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks supporting proposal evaluation shall be documented in the contract file.</p>
<a name="wp1088905"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) <em class="cEmphasis">Cost or price evaluation</em>. Normally, competition establishes price reasonableness. Therefore, when contracting on a firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment basis, comparison of the proposed prices will usually satisfy the requirement to perform a price analysis, and a cost analysis need not be performed. In limited situations, a cost analysis (see <a href="Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1208385">15.403-1</a>(c)(1)(i)(B)) may be appropriate to establish reasonableness of the otherwise successful offeror&rsquo;s price. When contracting on a cost-reimbursement basis, evaluations shall include a cost realism analysis to determine what the Government should realistically expect to pay for the proposed effort, the offeror&rsquo;s understanding of the work, and the offeror&rsquo;s ability to perform the contract. (See <a href="Subpart%2037_1.html#wp1082985">37.115</a> for uncompensated overtime evaluation.) The contracting officer shall document the cost or price evaluation.
      </p>
<a name="wp1088906"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Past performance evaluation.</p>
<a name="wp1088907"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Past performance information is one indicator of an offeror&rsquo;s ability to perform the contract successfully. The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor&rsquo;s performance shall be considered. This comparative assessment of past performance information is separate from the responsibility determination required under <a href="Subpart%209_1.html#wp1084058">subpart 9.1</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1088908"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The solicitation shall describe the approach for evaluating past performance, including evaluating offerors with no relevant performance history, and shall provide offerors an opportunity to identify past or current contracts (including Federal, State, and local government and private) for efforts similar to the Government requirement. The solicitation shall also authorize offerors to provide information on problems encountered on the identified contracts and the offeror&rsquo;s corrective actions. The Government shall consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror&rsquo;s past performance. The source selection authority shall determine the relevance of similar past performance information.</p>
<a name="wp1088909"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) The evaluation should take into account past performance information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.</p>
<a name="wp1088910"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p>
<a name="wp1088911"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) The evaluation should include the past performance of offerors in complying with subcontracting plan goals for small disadvantaged business (SDB) concerns (see <a href="Subpart%2019_7.html#wp1088741">subpart 19.7</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1088912"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) <em class="cEmphasis">Technical evaluation</em>. When tradeoffs are performed (see <a href="Subpart%2015_1.html#wp1095855">15.101-1</a>), the source selection records shall include—
      </p>
<a name="wp1088913"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) An assessment of each offeror&rsquo;s ability to accomplish the technical requirements; and</p>
<a name="wp1088914"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) A summary, matrix, or quantitative ranking, along with appropriate supporting narrative, of each technical proposal using the evaluation factors.</p>
<a name="wp1088915"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) <em class="cEmphasis">Cost information.</em> Cost information may be provided to members of the technical evaluation team in accordance with agency procedures.

<a name="wp1088916"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) S<em class="cEmphasis">mall business subcontracting evaluation.</em> Solicitations must be structured to give offers from small business concerns the highest rating for the evaluation factors in <a href="#wp1088883">15.304</a>(c)(3)(ii) and (c)(4).
      </p>
<a name="wp1088917"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The source selection authority may reject all proposals received in response to a solicitation, if doing so is in the best interest of the Government.</p>

(a) Clarifications and award without discussions.</p>

(1) Agencies shall evaluate all proposals in accordance with <a href="#wp1088903">15.305</a>(a), and, if discussions are to be conducted, establish the competitive range.

<a name="wp1088935"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) After evaluating all proposals in accordance with <a href="#wp1088903">15.305</a>(a) and paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the contracting officer may determine that the number of most highly rated proposals that might otherwise be included in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted. Provided the solicitation notifies offerors that the competitive range can be limited for purposes of efficiency (see <a href="52_215.html#wp1144408">52.215-1</a>(f)(4)), the contracting officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t09t12+37+408++%2810%29%20%2">10 U.S.C. 2305(b)(4)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 3703</a>).

(d) <em class="cEmphasis">Exchanges with offerors after establishment of the competitive range</em>. Negotiations are exchanges, in either a competitive or sole source environment, between the Government and offerors, that are undertaken with the intent of allowing the offeror to revise its proposal. These negotiations may include bargaining. Bargaining includes persuasion, alteration of assumptions and positions, give-and-take, and may apply to price, schedule, technical requirements, type of contract, or other terms of a proposed contract. When negotiations are conducted in a competitive acquisition, they take place after establishment of the competitive range and are called discussions.

(3) At a minimum, the contracting officer must, subject to paragraphs (d)(5) and (e) of this section and <a href="#wp1088950">15.307</a>(a), indicate to, or discuss with, each offeror still being considered for award, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not yet had an opportunity to respond. The contracting officer also is encouraged to discuss other aspects of the offeror&rsquo;s proposal that could, in the opinion of the contracting officer, be altered or explained to enhance materially the proposal&rsquo;s potential for award. However, the contracting officer is not required to discuss every area where the proposal could be improved. The scope and extent of discussions are a matter of contracting officer judgment.

<a name="wp1088942"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) In discussing other aspects of the proposal, the Government may, in situations where the solicitation stated that evaluation credit would be given for technical solutions exceeding any mandatory minimums, negotiate with offerors for increased performance beyond any mandatory minimums, and the Government may suggest to offerors that have exceeded any mandatory minimums (in ways that are not integral to the design), that their proposals would be more competitive if the excesses were removed and the offered price decreased.</p>
