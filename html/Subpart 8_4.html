(a) The Federal Supply Schedule program is also known as the GSA Schedules Program or the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The Federal Supply Schedule program is directed and managed by GSA and provides Federal agencies (see <a href="Subpart%208_1.html#wp1083190">8.004</a>) with a simplified process for obtaining commercial supplies and services at prices associated with volume buying. Indefinite delivery contracts are awarded to provide supplies and services at stated prices for given periods of time. GSA may delegate certain responsibilities to other agencies (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>GSA has delegated authority to the VA to procure medical supplies under the VA Federal Supply Schedules program). Orders issued under the VA Federal Supply Schedule program are covered by this subpart. Additionally, the Department of Defense (DoD) manages similar systems of schedule-type contracting for military items; however, DoD systems are not covered by this subpart.
      </p>
<a name="wp1089490"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) GSA schedule contracts require all schedule contractors to publish an &ldquo;Authorized Federal Supply Schedule Pricelist&rdquo; (pricelist). The pricelist contains all supplies and services offered by a schedule contractor. In addition, each pricelist contains the pricing and the terms and conditions pertaining to each Special Item Number that is on schedule. The schedule contractor is required to provide one copy of its pricelist to any ordering activity upon request. Also, a copy of the pricelist may be obtained from the Federal Supply Service by submitting a written e-mail request to <a href="mailto:schedules.infocenter@gsa.gov">schedules.infocenter@gsa.gov</a> or by telephone at 1-800-488-3111. This subpart, together with the pricelists, contain necessary information for placing delivery or task orders with schedule contractors. In addition, the GSA schedule contracting office issues Federal Supply Schedules publications that contain a general overview of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) program and address pertinent topics. Ordering activities may request copies of schedules publications by contacting the Centralized Mailing List Service through the Internet at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gsa.gov/cmls">http://www.gsa.gov/cmls</a>, submitting written e-mail requests to <a href="mailto:CMLS@gsa.gov">CMLS@gsa.gov</a>; or by completing GSA Form 457, FSS Publications Mailing List Application, and mailing it to the GSA Centralized Mailing List Service (7SM), P.O. Box 6477, Fort Worth, TX 76115. Copies of GSA Form 457 may also be obtained from the above-referenced points of contact.

Therefore, ordering activities are not required to make a separate determination of fair and reasonable pricing, except for a price evaluation as required by <a href="#wp1091211">8.405-2</a>(d). By placing an order against a schedule contract using the procedures in <a href="#wp1097400">8.405</a>, the ordering activity has concluded that the order represents the best value (as defined in FAR <a href="Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145508">2.101</a>) and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government&rsquo;s needs.
