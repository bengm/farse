This subpart provides policies and procedures for commercial financing arrangements under commercial purchases pursuant to <a href="FARTOCP12.html#wp1033864">Part 12</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054382"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
32.201  Statutory authority.</h3>
<a name="wp1054383"> </a><p class="pBody">
<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">10 U.S.C. 2307(f)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 4505</a> provide that payment for commercial items may be made under such terms and conditions as the head of the agency determines are appropriate or customary in the commercial marketplace and are in the best interest of the United States.

32.202-1  Policy.</h3>
<a name="wp1054386"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Use of financing in contracts. </em>It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide all resources needed for performance of the contract. Thus, for purchases of commercial items, financing of the contract is normally the contractor&rsquo;s responsibility. However, in some markets the provision of financing by the buyer is a commercial practice. In these circumstances, the contracting officer may include appropriate financing terms in contracts for commercial purchases when doing so will be in the best interest of the Government.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054387"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Authorization. </em>Commercial interim payments and commercial advance payments may be made under the following circumstances—
      </p>
<a name="wp1054388"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The contract item financed is a commercial supply or service;</p>
<a name="wp1054389"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The contract price exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold;</p>
<a name="wp1054390"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer determines that it is appropriate or customary in the commercial marketplace to make financing payments for the item;</p>
<a name="wp1054391"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Authorizing this form of contract financing is in the best interest of the Government (see paragraph (e) of this subsection);</p>
<a name="wp1054392"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Adequate security is obtained (see <a href="#wp1054411">32.202-4</a>);
      </p>
<a name="wp1054393"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(6) Prior to any performance of work under the contract, the aggregate of commercial advance payments shall not exceed 15 percent of the contract price;</p>
<a name="wp1054394"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(7) The contract is awarded on the basis of competitive procedures or, if only one offer is solicited, adequate consideration is obtained (based on the time value of the additional financing to be provided) if the financing is expected to be substantially more advantageous to the offeror than the offeror&rsquo;s normal method of customer financing; and</p>
<a name="wp1054395"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(8) The contracting officer obtains concurrence from the payment office concerning liquidation provisions when required by <a href="#wp1054441">32.206</a>(e).
      </p>
<a name="wp1054396"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) <em class="cEmphasis">Difference from non-commercial financing. </em>Government financing of commercial purchases under this subpart is expected to be different from that used for non-commercial purchases under <a href="Subpart%2032_1.html#wp1027526">Subpart 32.1</a> and its related subparts. While the contracting officer may adapt techniques and procedures from the non-commercial subparts for use in implementing commercial contract financing arrangements, the contracting officer must have a full understanding of effects of the differing contract environments and of what is needed to protect the interests of the Government in commercial contract financing.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054397"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) <em class="cEmphasis">Unusual contract financing. </em>Any contract financing arrangement not in accord with the requirements of agency regulations or this part is unusual contract financing and requires advance approval in accordance with agency procedures. If not otherwise specified, such unusual contract financing shall be approved by the head of the contracting activity.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054398"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) <em class="cEmphasis">Best interest of the Government. </em>The statutes cited in <a href="#wp1054382">32.201</a> do not allow contract financing by the Government unless it is in the best interest of the United States. Agencies may establish standards to determine whether contract financing is in the best interest of the Government. These standards may be for certain types of procurements, certain types of items, or certain dollar levels of procurements.

&ldquo;Commercial advance payment,&rdquo; as used in this subsection, means a payment made before any performance of work under the contract.

32.202-3  Conducting market research about financing terms.</h3>

Contract financing may be a subject included in the market research conducted in accordance with <a href="FARTOCP10.html#wp266706">Part 10</a>. If market research for contract financing is conducted, the contracting officer should consider—
      </p>

32.202-4  Security for Government financing.</h3>

(a) Policy.</p>
<a name="wp1054413"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t09t12+37+408++%2810%29%20%2">10 U.S.C. 2307(f)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 4505</a> require the Government to obtain adequate security for Government financing. The contracting officer shall specify in the solicitation the type of security the Government will accept. If the Government is willing to accept more than one form of security, the offeror shall be required to specify the form of security it will provide. If acceptable to the contracting officer, the resulting contract shall specify the security (see <a href="#wp1054441">32.206</a>(b)(1)(iv)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1054414"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Subject to agency regulations, the contracting officer may determine the offeror&rsquo;s financial condition to be adequate security, provided the offeror agrees to provide additional security should that financial condition become inadequate as security (see paragraph (c) of the clause at <a href="52_232.html#wp1153230">52.232-29</a>, Terms for Financing of Purchases of Commercial Items). Assessment of the contractor&rsquo;s financial condition shall consider both net worth and liquidity. If the contracting officer finds the offeror&rsquo;s financial condition is not adequate security, the contracting officer shall require other adequate security. Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this subsection list other (but not all) forms of security that the contracting officer may find acceptable.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054415"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The value of the security must be at least equal to the maximum unliquidated amount of contract financing payments to be made to the contractor. The value of security may be adjusted periodically during contract performance, as long as it is always equal to or greater than the amount of unliquidated financing.</p>
<a name="wp1054416"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Paramount lien.</p>
<a name="wp1054417"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The statutes cited in <a href="#wp1054382">32.201</a> provide that if the Government&rsquo;s security is in the form of a lien, such lien is paramount to all other liens and is effective immediately upon the first payment, without filing, notice, or other action by the United States.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054418"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) When the Government&rsquo;s security is in the form of a lien, the contract shall specify what the lien is upon, <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>the work in process, the contractor&rsquo;s plant, or the contractor&rsquo;s inventory. Contracting officers may be flexible in the choice of assets. The contract must also give the Government a right to verify the existence and value of the assets.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054419"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Provision of Government financing shall be conditioned upon a contractor certification that the assets subject to the lien are free from any prior encumbrances. Prior liens may result from such things as capital equipment loans, installment purchases, working capital loans, various lines of credit, and revolving credit arrangements.</p>
<a name="wp1054420"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) <em class="cEmphasis">Other assets as security. </em>Contracting officers may consider the guidance at <a href="Subpart%2028_2.html#wp1073352">28.203-2</a>, <a href="Subpart%2028_2.html#wp1073377">28.203-3</a>, and <a href="Subpart%2028_2.html#wp1073424">28.204</a> in determining which types of assets may be acceptable as security. For the purpose of applying the guidance in <a href="FARTOCP28.html#wp227535">Part 28</a> to this subsection, the term &ldquo;surety&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;individual surety&rdquo; should be interpreted to mean &ldquo;offeror&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;contractor.&rdquo;
      </p>
<a name="wp1054421"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) <em class="cEmphasis">Other forms of security. </em>Other acceptable forms of security include—
      </p>
<a name="wp1054422"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) An irrevocable letter of credit from a federally insured financial institution;</p>
<a name="wp1054423"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) A bond from a surety, acceptable in accordance with <a href="FARTOCP28.html#wp227535">Part 28</a> (note that the bond must guarantee repayment of the unliquidated contract financing);
      </p>
<a name="wp1054424"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) A guarantee of repayment from a person or corporation of demonstrated liquid net worth, connected by significant ownership to the contractor; or</p>
<a name="wp1054425"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Title to identified contractor assets of adequate worth.</p>
<a name="wp1054426"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) <em class="cEmphasis">Management of risk and security. </em>In establishing contract financing terms, the contracting officer must be aware of certain risks. For example, very high amounts of financing early in the contract (front-end loading) may unduly increase the risk to the Government. The security and the amounts and timing of financing payments must be analyzed as a whole to determine whether the arrangement will be in the best interest of the Government.

32.203  Determining contract financing terms.</h3>
<a name="wp1054428"> </a><p class="pBody">
When the criteria in <a href="#wp1054385">32.202-1</a>(b) are met, the contracting officer may either specify the financing terms in the solicitation (see <a href="#wp1054429">32.204</a>) or permit each offeror to propose its own customary financing terms (see <a href="#wp1054431">32.205</a>). When the contracting officer has sufficient information on financing terms that are customary in the commercial marketplace for the item, those terms may be specified in the solicitation.
      </p>
<a name="wp1054429"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
32.204  Procedures for contracting officer-specified commercial contract financing.</h3>
<a name="wp1054430"> </a><p class="pBody">
The financing terms shall be included in the solicitation. Contract financing shall not be a factor in the evaluation of resulting proposals, and proposals of alternative financing terms shall not be accepted (but see <a href="Subpart%2014_2.html#wp1096836">14.208</a> and <a href="Subpart%2015_2.html#wp1125408">15.206</a> concerning amendments of solicitations). However, an offer stating that the contracting officer-specified contract financing terms will not be used by the offeror does not alter the evaluation of the offer, nor does it render the offer nonresponsive or otherwise unacceptable. In the event of award to an offeror who declined the proposed contract financing, the contract financing provisions shall not be included in the resulting contract. Contract financing shall not be a basis for adjusting offerors&rsquo; proposed prices, because the effect of contract financing is reflected in each offeror&rsquo;s proposed prices.

32.205  Procedures for offeror-proposed commercial contract financing.</h3>
<a name="wp1054432"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Under this procedure, each offeror may propose financing terms. The contracting officer must then determine which offer is in the best interests of the United States.</p>
<a name="wp1054433"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Solicitations. </em>The contracting officer must include in the solicitation the provision at <a href="52_232.html#wp1153279">52.232-31</a>, Invitation to Propose Financing Terms. The contracting officer must also—
      </p>
<a name="wp1054434"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Specify the delivery payment (invoice) dates that will be used in the evaluation of financing proposals; and</p>

(c) Evaluation of proposals.</p>
<a name="wp1054437"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) When contract financing terms vary among offerors, the contracting officer must adjust each proposed price for evaluation purposes to reflect the cost of providing the proposed financing in order to determine the total cost to the Government of that particular combination of price and financing.</p>
<a name="wp1054438"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Contract financing results in the Government making payments earlier than it otherwise would. In order to determine the cost to the Government of making payments earlier, the contracting officer must compute the imputed cost of those financing payments and add it to the proposed price to determine the evaluated price for each offeror.</p>
<a name="wp1054439"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The imputed cost of a single financing payment is the amount of the payment multiplied by the annual interest rate, multiplied by the number of years, or fraction thereof, between the date of the financing payment and the date the amount would have been paid as a delivery payment. The imputed cost of financing is the sum of the imputed costs of each of the financing payments.</p>
<a name="wp1054440"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The contracting officer must calculate the time value of proposal-specified contract financing arrangements using as the interest rate the nominal discount rate specified in Appendix C of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94, &ldquo;Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs,&rdquo; appropriate to the period of contract financing. Where the period of proposed financing does not match the periods in the OMB Circular, the interest rate for the period closest to the finance period shall be used. Appendix C is updated yearly, and is available from the Office of Economic Policy in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</p>
