(1) The synopsis cannot be worded to preclude disclosure of an agency&rsquo;s needs and such disclosure would compromise the national security (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>would result in disclosure of classified information).

<a name="wp1107994"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The proposed contract action is made under the conditions described in <a href="Subpart%206_3.html#wp1086879">6.302-2</a> (or, for purchases conducted using simplified acquisition procedures, if unusual and compelling urgency precludes competition to the maximum extent practicable) and the Government would be seriously injured if the agency complies with the time periods specified in <a href="#wp1108011">5.203</a>;

(3) The proposed contract action is one for which either the written direction of a foreign government reimbursing the agency for the cost of the acquisition of the supplies or services for such government, or the terms of an international agreement or treaty between the United States and a foreign government, or international organizations, has the effect of requiring that the acquisition shall be from specified sources;</p>

(4) The proposed contract action is expressly authorized or required by a statute to be made through another Government agency, including acquisitions from the Small Business Administration (SBA) using the authority of section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (but see <a href="#wp1108025">5.205</a>(f)), or from a specific source such as a workshop for the blind under the rules of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled;

(8) The proposed contract action results from the acceptance of an unsolicited research proposal that demonstrates a unique and innovative concept (see <a href="Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145508">2.101</a>) and publication of any notice complying with <a href="#wp1108046">5.207</a> would improperly disclose the originality of thought or innovativeness of the proposed research, or would disclose proprietary information associated with the proposal.

5.203  Publicizing and response time.</h3>
<a name="wp1108012"> </a><p class="pBody">
Whenever agencies are required to publicize notice of proposed contract actions under <a href="#wp1107981">5.201</a>, they must proceed as follows:
      </p>
<a name="wp1108013"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) An agency must transmit a notice of proposed contract action to the GPE (see <a href="#wp1107981">5.201</a>). All publicizing and response times are calculated based on the date of publication. The publication date is the date the notice appears on the GPE. The notice must be published at least 15 days before issuance of a solicitation, or a proposed contract action the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of <a href="Subpart%206_3.html#wp1086852">6.302</a>, except that, for acquisitions of commercial items, the contracting officer may—
      </p>
<a name="wp1108014"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Establish a shorter period for issuance of the solicitation; or</p>
<a name="wp1108015"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Use the combined synopsis and solicitation procedure (see <a href="Subpart%2012_6.html#wp1088495">12.603</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1108016"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contracting officer must establish a solicitation response time that will afford potential offerors a reasonable opportunity to respond to each proposed contract action, (including actions where the notice of proposed contract action and solicitation information is accessible through the GPE), in an amount estimated to be greater than $25,000, but not greater than the simplified acquisition threshold; or each contract action for the acquisition of commercial items in an amount estimated to be greater than $25,000. The contracting officer should consider the circumstances of the individual acquisition, such as the complexity, commerciality, availability, and urgency, when establishing the solicitation response time.</p>
<a name="wp1108017"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Except for the acquisition of commercial items (see <a href="#wp1108011">5.203</a>(b)), agencies shall allow at least a 30-day response time for receipt of bids or proposals from the date of issuance of a solicitation, if the proposed contract action is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.
      </p>
<a name="wp1108018"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Agencies shall allow at least a 30 day response time from the date of publication of a proper notice of intent to contract for architect-engineer services or before issuance of an order under a basic ordering agreement or similar arrangement if the proposed contract action is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<a name="wp1108019"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Agencies must allow at least a 45-day response time for receipt of bids or proposals from the date of publication of the notice required in <a href="#wp1107981">5.201</a> for proposed contract actions categorized as research and development if the proposed contract action is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

<a name="wp1108020"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Nothing in this subpart prohibits officers or employees of agencies from responding to requests for information.</p>
<a name="wp1108021"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) Contracting officers may, unless they have evidence to the contrary, presume the notice was published one day after transmission to the GPE. This presumption does not negate the mandatory waiting or response times specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section. Upon learning that a particular notice has not in fact been published within the presumed timeframes, contracting officers should consider whether the date for receipt of offers can be extended or whether circumstances have become sufficiently compelling to justify proceeding with the proposed contract action under the authority of <a href="#wp1107990">5.202</a>(a)(2).
      </p>
<a name="wp1109194"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) In addition to other requirements set forth in this section, for acquisitions covered by the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or a Free Trade Agreement (see <a href="Subpart%2025_4.html#wp1086589">Subpart 25.4</a>), the period of time between publication of the synopsis notice and receipt of offers must be no less than 40 days. However, if the acquisition falls within a general category identified in an annual forecast, the availability of which is published, the contracting officer may reduce this time period to as few as 10 days.

5.204  Presolicitation notices.</h3>

5.205  Special situations.</h3>
<a name="wp1108026"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Research and development (R&amp;D) advance notices</em>. Contracting officers may transmit to the GPE advance notices of their interest in potential R&amp;D programs whenever market research does not produce a sufficient number of concerns to obtain adequate competition. Advance notices must not be used where security considerations prohibit such publication. Advance notices will enable potential sources to learn of R&amp;D programs and provide these sources with an opportunity to submit information which will permit evaluation of their capabilities. Contracting officers must consider potential sources which respond to advance notices for a subsequent solicitation. Advanced notices must be entitled &ldquo;Research and Development Sources Sought&rdquo; and include the name and telephone number of the contracting officer or other contracting activity official from whom technical details of the project can be obtained. This will enable sources to submit information for evaluation of their R&amp;D capabilities. Contracting officers must synopsize (see <a href="#wp1107981">5.201</a>) all subsequent solicitations for R&amp;D contracts, including those resulting from a previously synopsized advance notice, unless one of the exceptions in <a href="#wp1107990">5.202</a> applies.
