<a name="wp1078767"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contractors, whether or not their contracts are subject to CAS 416, are required by law and this regulation to provide insurance for certain types of perils (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>workers&rsquo; compensation). Insurance is mandatory also when commingling of property, type of operation, circumstances of ownership, or condition of the contract make it necessary for the protection of the Government. The minimum amounts of insurance required by this regulation (see <a href="#wp1078799">28.307-2</a>) may be reduced when a contract is to be performed outside the United States and its outlying areas. When more than one agency is involved, the agency responsible for review and approval of a contractor&rsquo;s insurance program shall coordinate with other interested agencies before acting on significant insurance matters.

(c) Contractors awarded nonpersonal services contracts for health care services are required to maintain medical liability insurance and indemnify the Government for liability producing acts or omissions by the contractor, its employees and agents (see <a href="Subpart%2037_4.html#wp1073874">37.400</a>).

When the Government requires the contractor to provide insurance coverage, the policies shall contain an endorsement that any cancellation or material change in the coverage adversely affecting the Government&rsquo;s interest shall not be effective unless the insurer or the contractor gives written notice of cancellation or change as required by the contracting officer. When the coverage is provided by self-insurance, the contractor shall not change or decrease the coverage without the administrative contracting officer&rsquo;s prior approval (see <a href="#wp1078807">28.308</a>(c)).

When the Government requires or approves insurance to cover loss of or damage to Government property (see <a href="Subpart%2045_1.html#wp1023576">45.104</a>, Responsibility and liability for Government property), it may be provided by specific insurance policies or by inclusion of the risks in the contractor&rsquo;s existing policies.

(a) <em class="cEmphasis">General</em>. Although the Government is not ordinarily concerned with the contractor&rsquo;s insurance coverage if the contract is a fixed-price contract, in special circumstances agencies may specify insurance requirements under fixed-price contracts. Examples of such circumstances include the following:
      </p>
<a name="wp1078787"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The contractor is, or has a separate operation, engaged principally in Government work.</p>

(2) When the clause at <a href="52_228_231.html#wp1137454">52.228-5</a>, Insurance—Work on a Government Installation, is not required by <a href="#wp1078838">28.310</a> but is included because the contracting officer considers it to be in the Government&rsquo;s interest to do so, any of the types of insurance specified in <a href="#wp1078794">28.307</a> may be omitted or the limits may be lowered, if appropriate.

(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Prior approval requirement</em>. Under cost-reimbursement contracts, before buying insurance under a group insurance plan, the contractor must submit the plan for approval, in accordance with agency regulations.

      </p>
<a name="wp1078798"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Premium refunds or credits</em>. The plan shall provide for the Government to share in any premium refunds or credits paid or otherwise allowed to the contractor.

Employer&rsquo;s liability coverage of at least $100,000 shall be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers&rsquo; compensation to be written by private carriers.

Policies covering automobiles operated in the United States shall provide coverage of at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage. The amount of liability coverage on other policies shall be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.

<a name="wp1078805"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) <em class="cEmphasis">Aircraft public and passenger liability</em>. When aircraft are used in connection with performing the contract, the contracting officer shall require aircraft public and passenger liability insurance.

Coverage for passenger liability bodily injury shall be at least $200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is greater.

28.308  Self-insurance.</h3>
<a name="wp1078808"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When it is anticipated that 50 percent or more of the self-insurance costs to be incurred at a segment of a contractor&rsquo;s business will be allocable to negotiated Government contracts, and the self-insurance costs at the segment for the contractor&rsquo;s fiscal year are expected to be $200,000 or more, the contractor shall submit, in writing, information on its proposed self-insurance program to the administrative contracting officer and obtain that official&rsquo;s approval of the program.

<a name="wp1078819"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Programs of self-insurance covering a contractor&rsquo;s insurable risks, including the deductible portion of purchased insurance, may be approved when examination of a program indicates that its application is in the Government&rsquo;s interest.

<a name="wp1078820"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

(c) Once the administrative contracting officer has approved a program, the contractor must submit to that official for approval any major proposed changes to the program. Any program approval may be withdrawn if a contracting officer finds that either—</p>

<a name="wp1078826"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The soundness of the contractor&rsquo;s financial condition, including available lines of credit.</p>
<a name="wp1078827"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The geographic dispersion of assets, so that the potential of a single loss depleting all the assets is unlikely.</p>
