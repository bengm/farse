(a) Fixed-price types of contracts provide for a firm price or, in appropriate cases, an adjustable price. Fixed-price contracts providing for an adjustable price may include a ceiling price, a target price (including target cost), or both. Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the ceiling price or target price is subject to adjustment only by operation of contract clauses providing for equitable adjustment or other revision of the contract price under stated circumstances. The contracting officer shall use firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment contracts when acquiring commercial items, except as provided in <a href="Subpart%2012_2.html#wp1087410">12.207</a>(b).

16.202-1  Description.</h3>
<a name="wp1091109"> </a><p class="pBody">
A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor&rsquo;s cost experience in performing the contract. This contract type places upon the contractor maximum risk and full responsibility for all costs and resulting profit or loss. It provides maximum incentive for the contractor to control costs and perform effectively and imposes a minimum administrative burden upon the contracting parties. The contracting officer may use a firm-fixed-price contract in conjunction with an award-fee incentive (see <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078278">16.404</a>) and performance or delivery incentives (see <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078229">16.402-2</a> and <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078238">16.402-3</a>) when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost. The contract type remains firm-fixed-price when used with these incentives.

<a name="wp1091118"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment provides for upward and downward revision of the stated contract price upon the occurrence of specified contingencies. Economic price adjustments are of three general types:</p>
<a name="wp1091119"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) <em class="cEmphasis">Adjustments based on established prices.</em> These price adjustments are based on increases or decreases from an agreed-upon level in published or otherwise established prices of specific items or the contract end items.

(2) <em class="cEmphasis">Adjustments based on actual costs of labor or material</em>. These price adjustments are based on increases or decreases in specified costs of labor or material that the contractor actually experiences during contract performance.

<a name="wp1091121"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) <em class="cEmphasis">Adjustments based on cost indexes of labor or material</em>. These price adjustments are based on increases or decreases in labor or material cost standards or indexes that are specifically identified in the contract.

(b) The contracting officer may use a fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment in conjunction with an award-fee incentive (see <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078278">16.404</a>) and performance or delivery incentives (see <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078229">16.402-2</a> and <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078238">16.402-3</a>) when the award fee or incentive is based solely on factors other than cost.

16.203-2  Application.</h3>
<a name="wp1091124"> </a><p class="pBody">
A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment may be used when (i) there is serious doubt concerning the stability of market or labor conditions that will exist during an extended period of contract performance, and (ii) contingencies that would otherwise be included in the contract price can be identified and covered separately in the contract. Price adjustments based on established prices should normally be restricted to industry-wide contingencies. Price adjustments based on labor and material costs should be limited to contingencies beyond the contractor&rsquo;s control. For use of economic price adjustment in sealed bid contracts, see <a href="Subpart%2014_4.html#wp1092945">14.408-4</a>.
