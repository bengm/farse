32.1102  Definitions.</h3>
<a name="wp1043970"> </a><p class="pBody">
As used in this subpart—</p>
<a name="wp1043971"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Electronic Funds Transfer information (EFT)&rdquo; means information necessary for making a payment by EFT through specified EFT mechanisms.</p>
<a name="wp1043972"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Governmentwide commercial purchase card&rdquo; means a card that is similar in nature to a commercial credit card that is used to make financing and delivery payments for supplies and services. The purchase card is an EFT method and it may be used as a means to meet the requirement to pay by EFT, to the extent that purchase card limits do not preclude such payments.</p>
<a name="wp1043973"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Payment information&rdquo; means the payment advice provided by the Government to the contractor that identifies what the payment is for, any computations or adjustments made by the Government, and any information required by the Prompt Payment Act.</p>
<a name="wp1043974"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
32.1103  Applicability.</h3>
<a name="wp1043975"> </a><p class="pBody">
The Government shall provide all contract payments through EFT except if—</p>
<a name="wp1043976"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The office making payment under a contract that requires payment by EFT, loses the ability to release payment by EFT. To the extent authorized by 31 CFR Part 208, the payment office shall make necessary payments pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of the clause at either <a href="52_232.html#wp1153351">52.232-33</a> or <a href="52_232.html#wp1153375">52.232-34</a> until such time as it can make EFT payments;
      </p>
<a name="wp1043977"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The payment is to be received by or on behalf of the contractor outside the United States and Puerto Rico (but see <a href="#wp1043991">32.1106</a>(b));

<a name="wp1043978"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) A contract is paid in other than United States currency (but see <a href="#wp1043991">32.1106</a>(b));
      </p>
<a name="wp1043979"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Payment by EFT under a classified contract could compromise the safeguarding of classified information or national security, or arrangements for appropriate EFT payments would be impractical due to security considerations;</p>
<a name="wp1043980"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) A contract is awarded by a deployed contracting officer in the course of military operations, including, but not limited to, contingency operations as defined in <a href="Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145508">2.101</a>, or a contract is awarded by any contracting officer in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to natural disasters or national or civil emergencies, if—

(2) EFT payment would not support the objectives of the operation;</p>
<a name="wp1043983"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) The agency does not expect to make more than one payment to the same recipient within a one-year period;</p>
<a name="wp1043984"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) An agency&rsquo;s need for supplies and services is of such unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than EFT;</p>
<a name="wp1043985"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) There is only one source for supplies and services and the Government would be seriously injured unless payment is made by a method other than EFT; or</p>

The Government shall protect against improper disclosure of contractors&rsquo; EFT information.</p>

32.1105  Assignment of claims.</h3>
<a name="wp1043990"> </a><p class="pBody">
The use of EFT payment methods is not a substitute for a properly executed assignment of claims in accordance with <a href="Subpart%2032_8.html#wp1029202">Subpart 32.8</a>. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims, is considered to be incorrect EFT information within the meaning of the &ldquo;Suspension of Payment&rdquo; paragraphs of the EFT clauses at <a href="52_232.html#wp1153351">52.232-33</a> and <a href="52_232.html#wp1153375">52.232-34</a>.

However, the head of an agency may authorize the use of any other EFT mechanism for domestic EFT with the concurrence of the office or agency responsible for making payments.
      </p>
<a name="wp1043993"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Nondomestic EFT mechanisms and other than United States currency. </em>The Government shall provide payment by other than EFT for payments received by or on behalf of the contractor outside the United States and Puerto Rico or for contracts paid in other than United States currency.

<a name="wp1043994"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The political, financial, and communications infrastructure in a foreign country supports payment by EFT; or</p>

<a name="wp1043996"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
32.1107  Payment information.</h3>

32.1108  Payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card.</h3>
<a name="wp1043999"> </a><p class="pBody">
A Governmentwide commercial purchase card charge authorizes the third party (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>financial institution) that issued the purchase card to make immediate payment to the contractor. The Government reimburses the third party at a later date for the third party&rsquo;s payment to the contractor.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044000"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The clause at <a href="52_232.html#wp1153445">52.232-36</a>, Payment by Third Party, governs when a contractor submits a charge against the purchase card for contract payment. The clause provides that the contractor shall make such payment requests by a charge to a Government account with the third party at the time the payment clause(s) of the contract authorizes the contractor to submit a request for payment, and for the amount due in accordance with the terms of the contract. To the extent that such a payment would otherwise be approved, the charge against the purchase card should not be disputed when the charge is reported to the Government by the third party. To the extent that such payment would otherwise not have been approved, an authorized individual (see <a href="Subpart%201_6.html#wp1050971">1.603-3</a>) shall take action to remove the charge, such as by disputing the charge with the third party or by requesting that the contractor credit the charge back to the Government under the contract.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044954"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b)(1) Written contracts to be paid by purchase card should include the clause at <a href="52_232.html#wp1153445">52.232-36</a>, Payment by Third Party, as prescribed by <a href="#wp1044007">32.1110</a>(d). However, payment by a purchase card also may be made under a contract that does not contain the clause to the extent the contractor agrees to accept that method of payment.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044955"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2)(i) When it is contemplated that the Governmentwide commercial purchase card will be used as the method of payment, and the contract or order is above the micro-purchase threshold, contracting officers are required to verify (by looking in the System for Award Management (SAM)) whether the contractor has any delinquent debt subject to collection under the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) at contract award and order placement. Information on TOP is available at <a target="_blank" href="http://fms.treas.gov/debt/index.html">http://fms.treas.gov/debt/index.html</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044957"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The contracting officer shall not authorize the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as a method of payment during any period the SAM indicates that the contractor has delinquent debt subject to collection under the TOP. In such cases, payments under the contract shall be made in accordance with the clause at <a href="52_232.html#wp1153351">52.232-33</a>, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or <a href="52_232.html#wp1153375">52.232-34</a>, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer—Other Than System for Award Management, as appropriate (see FAR <a href="#wp1044007">32.1110</a>(d)).

<a name="wp1044958"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Contracting officers shall not use the presence of the SAM debt flag indicator to exclude a contractor from receipt of the contract award or issuance or placement of an order.</p>
<a name="wp1044966"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) The contracting officer may take steps to authorize payment by Governmentwide commercial purchase card when a contractor alerts the contracting officer that the SAM debt flag indicator has been changed to no longer show a delinquent debt.</p>
<a name="wp1044971"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The clause at <a href="52_232.html#wp1153445">52.232-36</a>, Payment by Third Party, requires that the contract—
      </p>
<a name="wp1044003"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Identify the third party and the particular purchase card to be used; and</p>
<a name="wp1044004"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Not include the purchase card account number. The purchase card account number should be provided separately to the contractor.</p>

32.1109  EFT information submitted by offerors.</h3>
<a name="wp1044006"> </a><p class="pBody">
If offerors are required to submit EFT information prior to award, the successful offeror is not responsible for resubmitting this information after award of the contract except to make changes, or to place the information on invoices if required by agency procedures.
