The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day award is dated.

However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor&rsquo;s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically.

The Contractor is responsible for the delivery of each item quantity within allowable variations, if any. If the Contractor delivers and the Government receives quantities of any item in excess of the quantity called for (after considering any allowable variation in quantity), such excess quantities will be treated as being delivered for the convenience of the Contractor. The Government may retain such excess quantities up to $250 in value without compensating the Contractor therefor, and the Contractor waives all right, title, or interests therein. Quantities in excess of $250 will, at the option of the Government, either be returned at the Contractor&rsquo;s expense or retained and paid for by the Government at the contract unit price.</p>

If the quantity of a unit-priced item in this contract is an estimated quantity and the actual quantity of the unit-priced item varies more than 15 percent above or below the estimated quantity, an equitable adjustment in the contract price shall be made upon demand of either party. The equitable adjustment shall be based upon any increase or decrease in costs due solely to the variation above 115 percent or below 85 percent of the estimated quantity. If the quantity variation is such as to cause an increase in the time necessary for completion, the Contractor may request, in writing, an extension of time, to be received by the Contracting Officer within 10 days from the beginning of the delay, or within such further period as may be granted by the Contracting Officer before the date of final settlement of the contract. Upon the receipt of a written request for an extension, the Contracting Officer shall ascertain the facts and make an adjustment for extending the completion date as, in the judgement of the Contracting Officer, is justified.</p>
