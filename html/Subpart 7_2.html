(2) Does not exceed the quantity reasonably expected to be required by the agency.</p>
<a name="wp1083866"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Each solicitation for a contract for supplies is required, if practicable, to include a provision inviting each offeror responding to the solicitation—</p>
<a name="wp1083867"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) To state an opinion on whether the quantity of the supplies proposed to be acquired is economically advantageous to the Government; and</p>
<a name="wp1083868"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If applicable, to recommend a quantity or quantities which would be more economically advantageous to the Government. Each such recommendation is required to include a quotation of the total price and the unit price for supplies procured in each recommended quantity.</p>
<a name="wp1083869"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
7.203  Solicitation provision.</h3>
<a name="wp1083870"> </a><p class="pBody">
Contracting officers shall insert the provision at <a href="52_207_211.html#wp1140736">52.207-4</a>, Economic Purchase Quantity—Supplies, in solicitations for supplies. The provision need not be inserted if the solicitation is for a contract under the General Services Administration&rsquo;s multiple award schedule contract program, or if the contracting officer determines that—
      </p>

(a) The Government already has the data;</p>

(b) The data is otherwise readily available; or</p>
<a name="wp1083873"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) It is impracticable for the Government to vary its future requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1083874"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
7.204  Responsibilities of contracting officers.</h3>
<a name="wp1083875"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Contracting officers are responsible for transmitting offeror responses to the solicitation provision at <a href="52_207_211.html#wp1140736">52.207-4</a> to appropriate inventory management/requirements development activities in accordance with agency procedures. The economic purchase quantity data so obtained are intended to assist inventory managers in establishing and evaluating economic order quantities for supplies under their cognizance.
      </p>
<a name="wp1083876"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) In recognition of the fact that economic purchase quantity data furnished by offerors are only one of many data inputs required for determining the most economical order quantities, contracting officers should generally take no action to revise quantities to be acquired in connection with the instant procurement. However, if a significant price variation is evident from offeror responses, and the potential for significant savings is apparent, the contracting officer shall consult with the cognizant inventory manager or requirements development activity before proceeding with an award or negotiations. If this consultation discloses that the Government should be ordering an item of supply in different quantities and the inventory manager/requirements development activity concurs, the solicitation for the item should be amended or canceled and a new requisition should be obtained.</p>
