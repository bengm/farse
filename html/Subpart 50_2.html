<a name="wp1078429"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology (QATT)&rdquo; means any technology designed, developed, modified, procured, or sold for the purpose of preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism or limiting the harm such acts might otherwise cause, for which a SAFETY Act designation has been issued. For purposes of defining a QATT, technology means any product, equipment, service (including support services), device, or technology (including information technology) or any combination of the foregoing. Design services, consulting services, engineering services, software development services, software integration services, threat assessments, vulnerability studies, and other analyses relevant to homeland security may be deemed a technology.</p>

(a) Agencies should—</p>
<a name="wp1078446"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Determine whether the technology to be procured is appropriate for SAFETY Act protections and, if appropriate, formally relay this determination to DHS for purposes of supporting contractor application(s) for SAFETY Act protections in relation to criteria (b)(viii) of 6 CFR 25.4, Designation of Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technologies;</p>

50.205  Procedures.</h3>
<a name="wp1078453"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
50.205-1  SAFETY Act Considerations.</h3>
<a name="wp1078454"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">SAFETY Act applicability</em>. Requiring activities should review requirements to identify potential technologies that prevent, detect, identify, or deter acts of terrorism or limit the harm such acts might cause, and may be appropriate for SAFETY Act protections.  In questionable cases, the agency shall consult with DHS.  For acquisitions involving such technologies, the requiring activity should ascertain through discussions with DHS whether a block designation or block certification exists for the technology being acquired.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078455"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) If one does exist, the requiring activity should request that the contracting officer notify offerors.</p>
<a name="wp1078456"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If one does not exist, see <a href="#wp1078990">50.205-2</a>, Pre-qualification designation notice.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078852"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Early consideration of the SAFETY Act</em>. Acquisition officials shall consider SAFETY Act issues as early in the acquisition cycle as possible (see <a href="Subpart%207_1.html#wp1098095">7.105</a>(b)(20)(v)). Normally, this would be at the point where the required capabilities or performance characteristics are addressed. This is important because the processing times for issuing determinations on all types of SAFETY Act applications vary depending on many factors, including the influx of applications to DHS and the technical complexity of individual applications. 
      </p>
<a name="wp1078853"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) <em class="cEmphasis">Industry outreach</em>. When applicable, acquisition officials should include SAFETY Act considerations in all industry outreach efforts including, but not limited to, requests for information, draft requests for proposal, and industry conferences. 
      </p>
<a name="wp1078988"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) <em class="cEmphasis">Reciprocal waiver of claims</em>. For purposes of 6 CFR 25.5(e), the Government is not a customer from which a contractor must request a reciprocal waiver of claims.

50.205-2  Pre-qualification designation notice. </h3>
<a name="wp1078991"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Requiring activity responsibilities. </p>
<a name="wp1078630"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) If the requiring activity determines that the technology to be acquired may qualify for SAFETY Act protection, the requiring activity is responsible for requesting a pre-qualification designation notice from DHS. Such a request for a pre-qualification designation notice should be made once the requiring activity has determined that the technology specifications or statement of work are established and are unlikely to undergo substantive modification. DHS will then determine whether the technology identified in the request either affirmatively or presumptively satisfies the technical criteria for SAFETY Act designation. An affirmative determination means the technology described in the pre-qualification designation notice satisfies the technical criteria for SAFETY Act designation as a QATT. A presumptive determination means that the technology is a good candidate for SAFETY Act designation as a QATT. In either case, the notice will authorize offerors to—</p>
<a name="wp1078462"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Submit a streamlined application for SAFETY Act designation; and</p>
<a name="wp1078463"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Receive expedited review of their application for SAFETY Act designation.</p>
<a name="wp1078464"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The requiring activity shall make requests using the procurement pre-qualification request form available at<a target="_blank" href="http://www.SAFETYAct.gov"> http://www.SAFETYAct.gov</a>. The website includes instructions for completing and submitting the form.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078465"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The requiring activity shall provide a copy of the request, as well as a copy of the resulting pre-qualification designation notice or DHS denial, to the contracting officer.</p>
<a name="wp1079000"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Contracting officer responsibilities.</em> Upon receipt of the documentation specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this subsection, the contracting officer shall—

(1) Include in any pre-solicitation notice (<a href="Subpart%205_2.html#wp1107980">Subpart 5.2</a>) that a pre-qualification designation notice has been—

<a name="wp1078468"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Requested and is under review by DHS;</p>

50.205-3  Authorization of offers contingent upon SAFETY Act designation or certification before contract award.</h3>

(ii) For offers contingent upon SAFETY Act certification, a block certification;</p>
<a name="wp1078477"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) To the contracting officer&rsquo;s knowledge, the Government has not provided advance notice so that potential offerors could have obtained SAFETY Act designations/ certifications for their offered technologies before release of any solicitation; and</p>
<a name="wp1078478"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Market research shows that there will be insufficient competition without SAFETY Act protections or the subject technology would be sold to the Government only with SAFETY Act protections.</p>
<a name="wp1078479"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracting officers shall not authorize offers contingent upon obtaining a SAFETY Act certification (as opposed to a SAFETY Act designation), unless a block certification applies to the class of technology to be acquired under the solicitation.</p>
