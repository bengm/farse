It is further the policy of the United States that its prime contractors establish procedures to ensure the timely payment of amounts due pursuant to the terms of their subcontracts with small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns.</p>

      </p>
<a name="wp1088752"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

<a name="wp1088753"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) In sealed bidding acquisitions, each invitation for bids to perform a contract that is expected to exceed $700,000 ($1.5 million for construction) and that has subcontracting possibilities, shall require the bidder selected for award to submit a subcontracting plan. If the selected bidder fails to submit a plan within the time limit prescribed by the contracting officer, the bidder will be ineligible for award.</p>

(c) As stated in <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov">15 U.S.C. 637(d)(8)</a>, any contractor or subcontractor failing to comply in good faith with the requirements of the subcontracting plan is in material breach of its contract. Further, <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov">15 U.S.C. 637(d)(4)(F)</a> directs that a contractor&rsquo;s failure to make a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan shall result in the imposition of liquidated damages.

(c) In negotiated acquisitions, the contracting officer shall determine whether the plan is acceptable based on the negotiation of each of the 14 elements of the plan (see <a href="#wp1088766">19.704</a>).

The contracting officer shall take particular care to ensure that the offeror has not submitted unreasonably low goals to minimize exposure to liquidated damages and to avoid the administrative burden of substantiating good faith efforts. Additionally, particular attention should be paid to the identification of steps that, if taken, would be considered a good faith effort. No goal should be negotiated upward if it is apparent that a higher goal will significantly increase the Government&rsquo;s cost or seriously impede the attainment of acquisition objectives. An incentive subcontracting clause (see <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1136145">52.219-10</a>, Incentive Subcontracting Program), may be used when additional and unique contract effort, such as providing technical assistance, could significantly increase subcontract awards to small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, or women-owned small business concerns.

If the contracting officer decides in accordance with paragraph (d) of this subsection that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall give the contractor written notice specifying the failure, advising the contractor of the possibility that the contractor may have to pay to the Government liquidated damages, and providing a period of 15 working days (or longer period as necessary) within which to respond.

However, when considered in the context of the contractor&rsquo;s total effort in accordance with its plan, the following, though not all inclusive, may be considered as indicators of a failure to make a good faith effort: a failure to attempt to identify, contact, solicit, or consider for contract award small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business concerns; a failure to designate and maintain a company official to administer the subcontracting program and monitor and enforce compliance with the plan; a failure to submit the ISR, or the SSR, using the eSRS, or as provided in agency regulations; a failure to maintain records or otherwise demonstrate procedures adopted to comply with the plan; or the adoption of company policies or procedures that have as their objectives the frustration of the objectives of the plan.</p>

(e) If, after consideration of all the pertinent data, the contracting officer finds that the contractor failed to make a good faith effort to comply with its subcontracting plan, the contracting officer shall issue a final decision to the contractor to that effect and require the payment of liquidated damages in an amount stated. The contracting officer&rsquo;s final decision shall state that the contractor has the right to appeal under the clause in the contract entitled Disputes.</p>

(f) With respect to commercial plans approved under the clause at <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1136058">52.219-9</a>, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, the contracting officer that approved the plan shall—
      </p>
<a name="wp1088846"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Perform the functions of the contracting officer under this subsection on behalf of all agencies with contracts covered by the commercial plan;</p>
<a name="wp1088847"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Determine whether or not the goals in the commercial plan were achieved and, if they were not achieved, review all available information for an indication that the contractor has not made a good faith effort to comply with the plan, and document the results of the review;</p>
<a name="wp1088848"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) If a determination is made to assess liquidated damages, in order to calculate and assess the amount of damages, the contracting officer shall ask the contractor to provide—</p>
<a name="wp1088849"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Contract numbers for the Government contracts subject to the plan;</p>
<a name="wp1088850"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The total Government sales during the contractor&rsquo;s fiscal year; and</p>
<a name="wp1088851"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) The amount of payments made under the Government contracts subject to that plan that contributed to the contractor&rsquo;s total sales during the contractor&rsquo;s fiscal year; and</p>
<a name="wp1088852"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) When appropriate, assess liquidated damages on the Government&rsquo;s behalf, based on the pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government contracts. For example: The contractor&rsquo;s total actual sales were $50 million and its actual subcontracting was $20 million. The Government&rsquo;s total payments under contracts subject to the plan contributing to the contractor&rsquo;s total sales were $5 million, which accounted for 10 percent of the contractor&rsquo;s total sales. Therefore, the pro rata share of subcontracting attributable to the Government contracts would be 10 percent of $20 million, or $2 million. To continue the example, if the contractor failed to achieve its small business goal by 1 percent, the liquidated damages would be calculated as 1 percent of $2 million, or $20,000. The contracting officer shall make similar calculations for each category of small business where the contractor failed to achieve its goal and the sum of the dollars for all of the categories equals the amount of the liquidated damages to be assessed. A copy of the contracting officer&rsquo;s final decision assessing liquidated damages shall be provided to other contracting officers with contracts subject to the commercial plan.</p>
<a name="wp1088853"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) Liquidated damages shall be in addition to any other remedies that Government may have.</p>
<a name="wp1088854"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) Every contracting officer with a contract that is subject to a commercial plan shall include in the contract file a copy of the approved plan and a copy of the final decision assessing liquidating damages, if applicable.</p>
