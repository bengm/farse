19.301-1  Representation by the offeror.</h3>
<a name="wp1099295"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) To be eligible for award as a small business, an offeror must represent in good faith that it is a small business at the time of its written representation. An offeror may represent that it is a small business concern in connection with a specific solicitation if it meets the definition of a small business concern applicable to the solicitation and has not been determined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) to be other than a small business.</p>
<a name="wp1099296"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contracting officer shall accept an offeror&rsquo;s representation in a specific bid or proposal that it is a small business unless (1) another offeror or interested party challenges the concern&rsquo;s small business representation or (2) the contracting officer has a reason to question the representation. Challenges of and questions concerning a specific representation shall be referred to the SBA in accordance with <a href="#wp1099299">19.302</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1099297"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) An offeror&rsquo;s representation that it is a small business is not binding on the SBA. If an offeror&rsquo;s small business status is challenged, the SBA will evaluate the status of the concern and make a determination, which will be binding on the contracting officer, as to whether the offeror is a small business. A concern cannot become eligible for a specific award by taking action to meet the definition of a small business concern after the SBA has determined that it is not a small business.</p>
<a name="wp1099298"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) If the SBA determines that the status of a concern as a small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, or women-owned small business has been misrepresented in order to obtain a set-aside contract, an 8(a) subcontract, a subcontract that is to be included as part or all of a goal contained in a subcontracting plan, or a prime or subcontract to be awarded as a result, or in furtherance of any other provision of Federal law that specifically references Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act for a definition of program eligibility, the SBA may take action as specified in Sections 16(a) or 16(d) of the Act. If the SBA declines to take action, the agency may initiate the process. The SBA&rsquo;s regulations on penalties for misrepresentations and false statements are contained in 13 CFR 121.108 for small business, 13 CFR 124.501 for 8(a) small business, 13 CFR 124.1004 for small disadvantaged business, 13 CFR 125.29 for veteran or service-disabled veteran-owned small business, 13 CFR 126.900 for HUBZone small business, and 13 CFR 127.700 for economically disadvantaged women-owned small business concerns and women-owned small business (WOSB) concerns eligible under the WOSB Program.</p>

      </p>
<a name="wp1100737"> </a><p class="pBody">
<em class="cEmphasis">Long-term contract</em> means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1135887">52.217-8</a>, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

(d) After a contractor rerepresents it is other than small in accordance with <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1139913">52.219-28</a>, the agency may no longer include the value of options exercised, modifications issued, orders issued, or purchases made under blanket purchase agreements on that contract in its small business prime contracting goal achievements. Agencies should issue a modification to the contract capturing the rerepresentation and report it to FPDS within 30 days after notification of the rerepresentation.
      </p>
<a name="wp1100665"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) A change in size status does not change the terms and conditions of the contract. However, the contracting officer may require a subcontracting plan for a contract containing <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1136058">52.219-9</a>, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, if a prime contractor's size status changes from small to other than small as a result of a size rerepresentation (see <a href="Subpart%2019_7.html#wp1088791">19.705-2</a>(b)(3)).

<a name="wp1101934"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) An offeror, the SBA, or another interested party may protest the small business representation of an offeror in a specific offer.  However, for competitive 8(a) contracts, the filing of a protest is limited to an offeror, the contracting officer, or the SBA.</p>
<a name="wp1099301"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Any time after offers are opened, the contracting officer may question the small business representation of any offeror in a specific offer by filing a contracting officer&rsquo;s protest (see paragraph (c) of this section).</p>

(c)(1) Any contracting officer who receives a protest, whether timely or not, or who, as the contracting officer, wishes to protest the small business representation of an offeror, or rerepresentation of a contractor, shall promptly forward the protest to the SBA Government Contracting Area Director at the Government Contracting Area Office serving the area in which the headquarters of the offeror is located.</p>
<a name="wp1099303"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The protest, or confirmation if the protest was initiated orally, shall be in writing and shall contain the basis for the protest with specific, detailed evidence to support the allegation that the offeror is not small.

<a name="wp1099305"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) To be timely, a protest by any concern or other interested party must be received by the contracting officer (see paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section) by the close of business of the fifth business day after bid opening (in sealed bid acquisitions) or receipt of the special notification from the contracting officer that identifies the apparently successful offeror (in negotiated acquisitions) (see <a href="Subpart%2015_5.html#wp1095197">15.503</a>(a)(2)).

<a name="wp1102055"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) A protest filed before bid opening, or notification to offerors of the selection of the apparent successful offeror, will be dismissed as premature by SBA.</p>

<a name="wp1099315"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Award may be made to a protested concern after the SBA Area Office has determined that either the protested concern is an eligible small business or has dismissed all protests against it.</p>

(g)(1) After receiving a protest involving an offeror being considered for award, the contracting officer shall not award the contract until the SBA has made a size determination or 15 business days have expired since SBA&rsquo;s receipt of a protest, whichever occurs first; however, award shall not be withheld when the contracting officer determines in writing that an award must be made to protect the public interest.</p>
<a name="wp1099317"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If SBA has not made a determination within 15 business days, or within any extension of time granted by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may award the contract after determining in writing that there is an immediate need to award the contract and that waiting until SBA makes its determination will be disadvantageous to the Government.</p>
<a name="wp1099318"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) SBA may, at its sole discretion, reopen a formal size determination to correct an error or mistake, if it is within the appeal period and no appeal has been filed with OHA or, a final decision has not been rendered by the SBA Area Office or OHA.</p>
<a name="wp1099319"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) If a protest is received that challenges the small business status of an offeror not being considered for award, the contracting officer is not required to suspend contract action.  The contracting officer shall forward the protest to the SBA (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section) with a notation that the concern is not being considered for award, and shall notify the protester of this action.</p>
<a name="wp1102119"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) An appeal from an SBA size determination may be filed by any concern or other interested party whose protest of the small business representation of another concern has been denied by an SBA Government Contracting Area Director, any concern or other interested party that has been adversely affected by an SBA Government Contracting Area Director&rsquo;s decision, or the SBA Associate Administrator for the SBA program involved.  The appeal must be filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals, Small Business Administration, Suite 5900, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416, within the time limits and in strict accordance with the procedures contained in Subpart C of 13 CFR 134.  It is within the discretion of the SBA Judge whether to accept an appeal from a size determination.  If a post-award appeal is submitted to OHA within the time limits specified in Subpart C of 13 CFR 134, the contracting officer shall consider suspending contract performance until an SBA Judge decides the appeal.  SBA will inform the contracting officer of its ruling on the appeal.  SBA&rsquo;s decision, if received before award, will apply to the pending acquisition.  If the contracting officer has made a written determination in accordance with (g)(1) or (2) of this section, the contract has been awarded, the SBA rulings is received after award, and OHA finds the protested concern to be ineligible for award, the contracting officer shall terminate the contract unless termination is not in the best interests of the Government, in keeping with the circumstances described in the written determination.  However, the contracting officer shall not exercise any options or award further task or delivery orders.</p>
<a name="wp1099323"> </a><p class="pBody">
(i) SBA will dismiss untimely protests.  A protest that is not timely, even though received before award, shall be forwarded to the SBA Government Contracting Area Office (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section), with a notation on it that the protest is not timely.

19.303  Determining North American Industry Classification System codes and size standards.</h3>
<a name="wp1099325"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a)(1) The contracting officer shall determine the appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and related small business size standard and include them in solicitations above the micro-purchase threshold.  For information on size standards matched to industry NAICS codes, including the use of new NAICS codes, see also 19.102(a).</p>
<a name="wp1102165"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The contracting officer shall select the NAICS code which best describes the principal purpose of the product or service being acquired.  Primary consideration is given to the industry descriptions in the U.S. NAICS Manual, the product or service description in the solicitation and any attachments to it, the relative value and importance of the components of the procurement making up the end item being procured, and the function of the goods or services being purchased.  A procurement is usually classified according to the component which accounts for the greatest percentage of contract value.  A concern that submits an offer or quote for a contract where the NAICS code assigned to the contract is one for supplies, and furnishes a product it did not itself manufacture or produce, is categorized as a nonmanufacturer and deemed small if it meets the requirements of 19.102(f).</p>

(i) Any person adversely affected by a NAICS code designation or applicable size standard.  However, with respect to a particular sole source 8(a) contract, only the SBA Associate Administrator for Business Development may appeal a NAICS code designation; or</p>
