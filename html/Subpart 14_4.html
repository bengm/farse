14.400  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1090683"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart contains procedures for the receipt, handling, opening, and disposition of bids including mistakes in bids, and subsequent award of contracts.</p>
<a name="wp1090684"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
14.401  Receipt and safeguarding of bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1090685"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) All bids (including modifications) received before the time set for the opening of bids shall be kept secure. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the bids shall not be opened or viewed, and shall remain in a locked bid box, a safe, or in a secured, restricted-access electronic bid box. If an invitation for bids is cancelled, bids shall be returned to the bidders. Necessary precautions shall be taken to ensure the security of the bid box or safe. Before bid opening, information concerning the identity and number of bids received shall be made available only to Government employees. Such disclosure shall be only on a &ldquo;need to know&rdquo; basis. When bid samples are submitted, they shall be handled with sufficient care to prevent disclosure of characteristics before bid opening.</p>
<a name="wp1090686"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Envelopes marked as bids but not identifying the bidder or the solicitation may be opened solely for the purpose of identification, and then only by an official designated for this purpose. If a sealed bid is opened by mistake (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>because it is not marked as being a bid), the envelope shall be signed by the opener, whose position shall also be written thereon, and delivered to the designated official. This official shall immediately write on the envelope (1) an explanation of the opening, (2) the date and time opened, and (3) the invitation for bids number, and shall sign the envelope. The official shall then immediately reseal the envelope.

14.402  Opening of bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1090688"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
14.402-1  Unclassified bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1090689"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The bid opening officer shall decide when the time set for opening bids has arrived and shall inform those present of that decision. The officer shall then (1) personally and publicly open all bids received before that time, (2) if practical, read the bids aloud to the persons present, and (3) have the bids recorded. The original of each bid shall be carefully safeguarded, particularly until the abstract of bids required by <a href="#wp1090700">14.403</a> has been made and its accuracy verified.
      </p>
<a name="wp1090690"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Performance of the procedure in paragraph (a) of this section may be delegated to an assistant, but the bid opening officer remains fully responsible for the actions of the assistant.</p>
<a name="wp1090691"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Examination of bids by interested persons shall be permitted if it does not interfere unduly with the conduct of Government business. Original bids shall not be allowed to pass out of the hands of a Government official unless a duplicate bid is not available for public inspection. The original bid may be examined by the public only under the immediate supervision of a Government official and under conditions that preclude possibility of a substitution, addition, deletion, or alteration in the bid.</p>
<a name="wp1090692"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
14.402-2  Classified bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1090693"> </a><p class="pBody">
The general public may not attend bid openings for classified acquisitions. A bidder or its representative may attend and record the results if the individual has the appropriate security clearance. The contracting officer also may make the bids available at a later time to properly cleared individuals who represent bidders. No public record shall be made of bids or bid prices received in response to classified invitations for bids.</p>

14.402-3  Postponement of openings.</h3>
<a name="wp1090695"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A bid opening may be postponed even after the time scheduled for bid opening (but otherwise in accordance with <a href="Subpart%2014_2.html#wp1096836">14.208</a>) when—
      </p>
<a name="wp1090696"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The contracting officer has reason to believe that the bids of an important segment of bidders have been delayed in the mails, or in the communications system specified for transmission of bids, for causes beyond their control and without their fault or negligence (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>flood, fire, accident, weather conditions, strikes, or Government equipment blackout or malfunction when bids are due); or
      </p>
<a name="wp1090697"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Emergency or unanticipated events interrupt normal governmental processes so that the conduct of bid opening as scheduled is impractical.</p>
<a name="wp1090698"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) At the time of a determination to postpone a bid opening under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an announcement of the determination shall be publicly posted. If practical before issuance of a formal amendment of the invitation, the determination shall be otherwise communicated to prospective bidders who are likely to attend the scheduled bid opening.</p>
<a name="wp1090699"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) In the case of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, and when urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation as prescribed in <a href="Subpart%2014_2.html#wp1096836">14.208</a>, the time specified for opening of bids will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. In such cases, the time of actual bid opening shall be deemed to be the time set for bid opening for the purpose of determining &ldquo;late bids&rdquo; under <a href="Subpart%2014_3.html#wp1086670">14.304</a>. A note should be made on the abstract of bids or otherwise added to the file explaining the circumstances of the postponement.

14.403  Recording of bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1092636"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <a href="FormsStandard41.html#wp1176913">Standard Form 1409</a>, Abstract of Offers, or <a href="FormsOptional9.html#wp1151440">Optional Form 1419</a>, Abstract of Offers—Construction (or automated equivalent), shall be completed and certified as to its accuracy by the bid opening officer as soon after bid opening as practicable. Where bid items are too numerous to warrant complete recording of all bids, abstract entries for individual bids may be limited to item numbers and bid prices. In preparing these forms, the extra columns and <a href="FormsStandard42.html#wp1176917">SF 1410</a>, Abstract of Offers—Continuation, and <a href="FormsOptional10.html#wp1150180">OF 1419A</a>, Abstract of Offer—Construction, Continuation Sheet, may be used to label and record such information as the contracting activity deems necessary.
      </p>
<a name="wp1090702"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Abstracts of offers for unclassified acquisitions shall be available for public inspection. Such abstracts shall not contain information regarding failure to meet minimum standards of responsibility, apparent collusion of bidders, or other notations properly exempt from disclosure to the public in accordance with agency regulations implementing <a href="Subpart%2024_2.html#wp1074019">Subpart 24.2</a>.

14.404-1  Cancellation of invitations after opening.</h3>
<a name="wp1090707"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a)(1) Preservation of the integrity of the competitive bid system dictates that, after bids have been opened, award must be made to that responsible bidder who submitted the lowest responsive bid, unless there is a compelling reason to reject all bids and cancel the invitation.</p>
<a name="wp1090708"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Every effort shall be made to anticipate changes in a requirement before the date of opening and to notify all prospective bidders of any resulting modification or cancellation. This will permit bidders to change their bids and prevent unnecessary exposure of bid prices.</p>
<a name="wp1090709"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) As a general rule, after the opening of bids, an invitation should not be cancelled and resolicited due solely to increased requirements for the items being acquired. Award should be made on the initial invitation for bids and the additional quantity should be treated as a new acquisition.</p>
<a name="wp1090710"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) When it is determined before award but after opening that the requirements of <a href="Subpart%2011_2.html#wp1081862">11.201</a> (relating to the availability and identification of specifications) have not been met, the invitation shall be cancelled.
      </p>
<a name="wp1090711"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Invitations may be cancelled and all bids rejected before award but after opening when, consistent with subparagraph (a)(1) of this section, the agency head determines in writing that—</p>
<a name="wp1090712"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Inadequate or ambiguous specifications were cited in the invitation;</p>
<a name="wp1090713"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Specifications have been revised;</p>
<a name="wp1090714"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The supplies or services being contracted for are no longer required;</p>
<a name="wp1090715"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The invitation did not provide for consideration of all factors of cost to the Government, such as cost of transporting Government-furnished property to bidders&rsquo; plants;</p>
<a name="wp1090716"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Bids received indicate that the needs of the Government can be satisfied by a less expensive article differing from that for which the bids were invited;</p>
<a name="wp1090717"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(6) All otherwise acceptable bids received are at unreasonable prices, or only one bid is received and the contracting officer cannot determine the reasonableness of the bid price;</p>
<a name="wp1090718"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(7) The bids were not independently arrived at in open competition, were collusive, or were submitted in bad faith (see <a href="Subpart%203_3.html#wp1087171">Subpart 3.3</a> for reports to be made to the Department of Justice);
      </p>
<a name="wp1090719"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(8) No responsive bid has been received from a responsible bidder;</p>
<a name="wp1090720"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(9) A cost comparison as prescribed in OMB Circular A-76 and <a href="Subpart%207_3.html#wp1091459">Subpart 7.3</a> shows that performance by the Government is more economical; or
      </p>
<a name="wp1090721"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(10) For other reasons, cancellation is clearly in the public&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<a name="wp1090722"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Should administrative difficulties be encountered after bid opening that may delay award beyond bidders&rsquo; acceptance periods, the several lowest bidders whose bids have not expired (irrespective of the acceptance period specified in the bid) should be requested, before expiration of their bids, to extend in writing the bid acceptance period (with consent of sureties, if any) in order to avoid the need for resoliciting.</p>
<a name="wp1090723"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Under some circumstances, completion of the acquisition after cancellation of the invitation for bids may be appropriate.</p>
<a name="wp1090724"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) If the invitation for bids has been cancelled for the reasons specified in subparagraphs (c)(6), (7), or (8) of this subsection, and the agency head has authorized, in the determination in paragraph (c) of this subsection, the completion of the acquisition through negotiation, the contracting officer shall proceed in accordance with paragraph (f) of this subsection.</p>
<a name="wp1090725"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If the invitation for bids has been cancelled for the reasons specified in subparagraphs (c)(1), (2), (4), (5), or (10) of this subsection, or for the reasons in subparagraphs (c)(6), (7), or (8) of this subsection and completion through negotiation is not authorized under subparagraph (e)(1) of this subsection, the contracting officer shall proceed with a new acquisition.</p>
<a name="wp1090726"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) When the agency head has determined, in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this subsection, that an invitation for bids should be canceled and that use of negotiation is in the Government&rsquo;s interest, the contracting officer may negotiate (in accordance with <a href="FARTOCP15.html#wp246607">Part 15</a>, as appropriate) and make award without issuing a new solicitation provided—
      </p>
<a name="wp1090727"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Each responsible bidder in the sealed bid acquisition has been given notice that negotiations will be conducted and has been given an opportunity to participate in negotiations; and</p>
<a name="wp1090728"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The award is made to the responsible bidder offering the lowest negotiated price.</p>
<a name="wp1090729"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
14.404-2  Rejection of individual bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1090730"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Any bid that fails to conform to the essential requirements of the invitation for bids shall be rejected.</p>
<a name="wp1090731"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Any bid that does not conform to the applicable specifications shall be rejected unless the invitation authorized the submission of alternate bids and the supplies offered as alternates meet the requirements specified in the invitation.</p>
<a name="wp1090732"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Any bid that fails to conform to the delivery schedule or permissible alternates stated in the invitation shall be rejected.</p>
<a name="wp1090733"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) A bid shall be rejected when the bidder imposes conditions that would modify requirements of the invitation or limit the bidder&rsquo;s liability to the Government, since to allow the bidder to impose such conditions would be prejudicial to other bidders. For example, bids shall be rejected in which the bidder—</p>
<a name="wp1090734"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Protects against future changes in conditions, such as increased costs, if total possible costs to the Government cannot be determined;</p>
<a name="wp1090735"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Fails to state a price and indicates that price shall be &ldquo;price in effect at time of delivery;&rdquo;</p>
<a name="wp1090736"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) States a price but qualifies it as being subject to &ldquo;price in effect at time of delivery;&rdquo;</p>
<a name="wp1090737"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) When not authorized by the invitation, conditions or qualifies a bid by stipulating that it is to be considered only if, before date of award, the bidder receives (or does not receive) award under a separate solicitation;</p>
<a name="wp1090738"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Requires that the Government is to determine that the bidder&rsquo;s product meets applicable Government specifications; or</p>
<a name="wp1090739"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(6) Limits rights of the Government under any contract clause.</p>
<a name="wp1090740"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) A low bidder may be requested to delete objectionable conditions from a bid provided the conditions do not go to the substance, as distinguished from the form, of the bid, or work an injustice on other bidders. A condition goes to the substance of a bid where it affects price, quantity, quality, or delivery of the items offered.</p>
<a name="wp1090741"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines in writing that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well.</p>
<a name="wp1090742"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items or subline items are materially unbalanced (see <a href="Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1225484">15.404-1</a>(g)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1090743"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) Bids received from any person or concern that is suspended, debarred, proposed for debarment or declared ineligible as of the bid opening date shall be rejected unless a compelling reason determination is made (see <a href="Subpart%209_4.html#wp1083280">Subpart 9.4</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1090744"> </a><p class="pBody">
(i) Low bids received from concerns determined to be not responsible pursuant to subpart 9.1 shall be rejected (but if a bidder is a small business concern, see 19.6 with respect to certificates of competency).</p>
<a name="wp1090745"> </a><p class="pBody">
(j) When a bid guarantee is required and a bidder fails to furnish the guarantee in accordance with the requirements of the invitation for bids, the bid shall be rejected, except as otherwise provided in <a href="Subpart%2028_1.html#wp1086375">28.101-4</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1090746"> </a><p class="pBody">
(k) The originals of all rejected bids, and any written findings with respect to such rejections, shall be preserved with the papers relating to the acquisition.</p>
<a name="wp1090747"> </a><p class="pBody">
(l) After submitting a bid, if all of a bidder&rsquo;s assets or that part related to the bid are transferred during the period between the bid opening and the award, the transferee may not be able to take over the bid. Accordingly, the contracting officer shall reject the bid unless the transfer is effected by merger, operation of law, or other means not barred by <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 6305</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">31 U.S.C. 3727</a>.

14.404-3  Notice to bidders of rejection of all bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1090749"> </a><p class="pBody">
When it is determined necessary to reject all bids, the contracting officer shall notify each bidder that all bids have been rejected and shall state the reason for such action.</p>

14.404-4  Restrictions on disclosure of descriptive literature.</h3>
<a name="wp1090751"> </a><p class="pBody">
When a bid is accompanied by descriptive literature (as defined in <a href="Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145508">2.101</a>), and the bidder imposes a restriction that prevents the public disclosure of such literature, the restriction may render the bid nonresponsive. The restriction renders the bid nonresponsive if it prohibits the disclosure of sufficient information to permit competing bidders to know the essential nature and type of the products offered or those elements of the bid that relate to quantity, price, and delivery terms. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to unsolicited descriptive literature submitted by a bidder if such literature does not qualify the bid (see <a href="Subpart%2014_2.html#wp1096786">14.202-5</a>(e)).

<a name="wp1090752"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
14.404-5  All or none qualifications.</h3>
<a name="wp1090753"> </a><p class="pBody">
Unless the solicitation provides otherwise, a bid may be responsive notwithstanding that the bidder specifies that award will be accepted only on all, or a specified group, of the items. Bidders shall not be permitted to withdraw or modify &ldquo;all or none&rdquo; qualifications after bid opening since such qualifications are substantive and affect the rights of other bidders.</p>
<a name="wp1090754"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
14.405  Minor informalities or irregularities in bids.</h3>
<a name="wp1090755"> </a><p class="pBody">
A minor informality or irregularity is one that is merely a matter of form and not of substance. It also pertains to some immaterial defect in a bid or variation of a bid from the exact requirements of the invitation that can be corrected or waived without being prejudicial to other bidders. The defect or variation is immaterial when the effect on price, quantity, quality, or delivery is negligible when contrasted with the total cost or scope of the supplies or services being acquired. The contracting officer either shall give the bidder an opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity in a bid or waive the deficiency, whichever is to the advantage of the Government. Examples of minor informalities or irregularities include failure of a bidder to—</p>

(2) The amendment involves only a matter of form or has either no effect or merely a negligible effect on price, quantity, quality, or delivery of the item bid upon; and</p>

In order to minimize delays in contract awards, administrative determinations may be made as described in this <a href="#wp1090780">14.407-3</a> in connection with mistakes in bids alleged after opening of bids and before award. The authority to permit correction of bids is limited to bids that, as submitted, are responsive to the invitation and may not be used to permit correction of bids to make them responsive.

(a) If a bidder requests permission to correct a mistake and clear and convincing evidence establishes both the existence of the mistake and the bid actually intended, the agency head may make a determination permitting the bidder to correct the mistake; provided, that if this correction would result in displacing one or more lower bids, such a determination shall not be made unless the existence of the mistake and the bid actually intended are ascertainable substantially from the invitation and the bid itself.</p>

<a name="wp1090792"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The contracting officer shall immediately request the bidder to verify the bid. Action taken to verify bids must be sufficient to reasonably assure the contracting officer that the bid as confirmed is without error, or to elicit the allegation of a mistake by the bidder. To assure that the bidder will be put on notice of a mistake suspected by the contracting officer, the bidder should be advised as appropriate—</p>
<a name="wp1090793"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) That its bid is so much lower than the other bids or the Government&rsquo;s estimate as to indicate a possibility of error;</p>

(iv) Of any other information, proper for disclosure, that leads the contracting officer to believe that there is a mistake in bid.</p>
<a name="wp1090797"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If the bid is verified, the contracting officer shall consider the bid as originally submitted. If the time for acceptance of bids is likely to expire before a decision can be made, the contracting officer shall request all bidders whose bids may become eligible for award to extend the time for acceptance of their bids in accordance with <a href="#wp1090706">14.404-1</a>(d). If the bidder whose bid is believed erroneous does not (or cannot) grant an extension of time, the bid shall be considered as originally submitted (but see paragraph (g)(5) of this section). If the bidder alleges a mistake, the contracting officer shall advise the bidder to make a written request to withdraw or modify the bid. The request must be supported by statements (sworn statements, if possible) and shall include all pertinent evidence such as the bidder&rsquo;s file copy of the bid, the original worksheets and other data used in preparing the bid, subcontractors&rsquo; quotations, if any, published price lists, and any other evidence that establishes the existence of the error, the manner in which it occurred, and the bid actually intended.

(3) When the bidder furnishes evidence supporting an alleged mistake, the contracting officer shall refer the case to the appropriate authority (see paragraph (e) of this section) together with the following data:</p>

(i) A signed copy of the bid involved.</p>

(B) The expiration date of the bid in question and of the other bids submitted;</p>

<a name="wp1090811"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) When time is of the essence because of the expiration of bids or otherwise, the contracting officer may refer the case by telegraph or telephone to the appropriate authority. Ordinarily, the contracting officer will not refer mistake in bid cases by telegraph or telephone to the appropriate authority when the determination set forth in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section is applicable, since actual examination is generally necessary to determine whether the evidence presented is clear and convincing.</p>
<a name="wp1090812"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Where the bidder fails or refuses to furnish evidence in support of a suspected or alleged mistake, the contracting officer shall consider the bid as submitted unless (i) the amount of the bid is so far out of line with the amounts of other bids received, or with the amount estimated by the agency or determined by the contracting officer to be reasonable, or (ii) there are other indications of error so clear, as to reasonably justify the conclusion that acceptance of the bid would be unfair to the bidder or to other bona fide bidders. Attempts made to obtain the information required and the action taken with respect to the bid shall be fully documented.</p>
<a name="wp1090813"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) Each agency shall maintain records of all determinations made in accordance with this subsection <a href="#wp1090780">14.407-3</a>, the facts involved, and the action taken in each case. Copies of all such determinations shall be included in the file.
