<a name="wp1047466"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Payments under cost-reimbursement contracts, but see <a href="Subpart%2032_1.html#wp1025012">32.110</a> for progress payments made to subcontractors under cost-reimbursement prime contracts; or
      </p>

32.501  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1047469"> </a><p class="pBody">
Progress payments may be customary or unusual. Customary progress payments are those made under the general guidance in this subpart, using the customary progress payment rate, the cost base, and frequency of payment established in the Progress Payments clause, and either the ordinary liquidation method or the alternate method as provided in subsections <a href="#wp1047698">32.503-8</a> and <a href="#wp1047700">32.503-9</a>. Any other progress payments are considered unusual, and may be used only in exceptional cases when authorized in accordance with subsection <a href="#wp1047477">32.501-2</a>.

(b) The contracting officer must—</p>
<a name="wp1047473"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Consider any rate higher than those permitted in paragraph (a) of this section an unusual progress payment; and</p>
<a name="wp1047474"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Not include a higher rate in a contract unless advance agency approval is obtained as prescribed in <a href="#wp1047477">32.501-2</a>.

(c) When advance payments and progress payments are authorized under the same contract, the contracting officer must not authorize a progress payment rate higher than the customary rate.</p>

32.501-3  Contract price.</h3>
<a name="wp1047485"> </a><p class="pBody">

(a) The extent of progress payments supervision, by prepayment review or periodic review, should vary inversely with the contractor&rsquo;s experience, performance record, reliability, quality of management, and financial strength, and with the adequacy of the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system and controls. Supervision shall be of a kind and degree sufficient to provide timely knowledge of the need for, and timely opportunity for, any actions necessary to protect Government interests.</p>
<a name="wp1047541"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The administering office must keep itself informed of the contractor&rsquo;s overall operations and financial condition, since difficulties encountered and losses suffered in operations outside the particular progress payment contract may affect adversely the performance of that contract and the liquidation of the progress payments.</p>

<a name="wp1047547"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) So far as practicable, all cost problems, particularly those involving indirect costs, that are likely to create disagreements in future administration of the contract should be identified and resolved at the inception of the contract (see <a href="Subpart%2031_1.html#wp1089616">31.109</a>).

(b) For all other contractors, the ACO shall not approve progress payments before determining (1) that (i) the contractor will be capable of liquidating any progress payments or (ii) the Government is otherwise protected against loss by additional protective provisions, and (2) that the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system and controls are adequate for proper administration of progress payments. The services of the responsible audit agency or office should be used to the greatest extent practicable. However, if the auditor so advises, a complete audit may not be necessary.</p>

32.503-4  Approval of progress payment requests.</h3>

(a) When the reliability of the contractor and the adequacy of the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system and controls have been established (see <a href="#wp1047548">32.503-3</a> of this section) the ACO may, in approving any particular progress payment request (including initial requests on new contracts), rely upon that accounting system and upon the contractor&rsquo;s certification, without requiring audit or review of the request before payment.

(b) The ACO should not routinely ask for audits of progress payment requests. However, when there is reason to—</p>

(1) Question the reliability or accuracy of the contractor&rsquo;s certification; or</p>

32.503-5  Administration of progress payments.</h3>

(a) While the ACO may, in approving progress payment requests under <a href="#wp1047548">32.503-3</a> of this section, rely on the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system and certification without prepayment review, postpayment reviews (including audits when considered necessary) shall be made periodically, or when considered desirable by the ACO to determine the validity of progress payments already made and expected to be made.

(4) There is reason to doubt the adequacy and reliability of the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system and controls and certification.</p>
<a name="wp1047568"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Under indefinite-delivery contracts, the contracting officer should administer progress payments made under each individual order as if the order constituted a separate contract, unless agency procedures provide otherwise. When the contract will be administered by an agency other than the awarding agency, the contracting officer shall coordinate with the contract administration office if the awarding agency wants the administration of progress payments to be on a basis other than order-by-order.</p>

The Government recoups progress payments through the deduction of liquidations from payments that would otherwise be due to the contractor for completed contract items. To determine the amount of the liquidation, the contracting officer applies a liquidation rate to the contract price of contract items delivered and accepted. The ordinary method is that the liquidation rate is the same as the progress payment rate. At the beginning of a contract, the contracting officer must use this method.</p>

(a) Since the Progress Payments clause gives the Government title to all of the materials, work-in-process, finished goods, and other items of property described in paragraph (d) of the Progress Payments clause, under the contract under which progress payments have been made, the ACO must ensure that the Government title to these inventories is not compromised by other encumbrances.

(a) Under the Progress Payments clause, and except for normal spoilage, the contractor bears the risk of loss for Government property under the clause, even though title is vested in the Government, unless the Government has expressly assumed this risk.

(d) The contractor has a duty to ensure that financing payments to subcontractors conform to the standards and principles prescribed in paragraph (j) of the Progress Payments clause in the prime contract. Although the contracting officer should, to the extent appropriate, review the subcontract as part of the overall administration of progress payments in the prime contract, there is no special requirement for contracting officer review or consent merely because the subcontract includes financing payments, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.
