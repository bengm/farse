(b) If a special requirement exists for application of any of these terms and conditions to other types of contracts; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>cost-reimbursement contracts, for which transportation arrangements are normally the responsibility of the contractor and transportation costs are allowable, the contracting officer shall use the terms and conditions prescribed in this subpart as a guide for—

47.301  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1078676"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Transportation and traffic management factors are important in awarding and administering contracts to ensure that (1) acquisitions are made on the basis most advantageous to the Government and (2) supplies arrive in good order and condition and on time at the required place. (See <a href="Subpart%2047_1.html#wp1073583">47.104</a> for possible reduced transportation rates for Government shipments.)
      </p>
<a name="wp1078677"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The requiring activity shall—</p>

(2) Contract administration, modification, and termination, including the movement of property by the Government to and from contractors&rsquo; plants.</p>
<a name="wp1078684"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracting officers shall request transportation office participation especially before making an initial acquisition of supplies that are unusually large, heavy, high, wide, or long; have sensitive or dangerous characteristics; or lend themselves to containerized movements from the source. In determining total transportation charges, contracting officers shall also consider additional costs arising from factors such as the use of special equipment, excess blocking and bracing material, or circuitous routing.</p>

47.301-2  Participation of transportation officers.</h3>
<a name="wp1078686"> </a><p class="pBody">
Agencies&rsquo; transportation officers shall participate in the solicitation and evaluation of offers to ensure that all necessary transportation factors, such as transportation costs, transit arrangements, time in transit, and port capabilities, are considered and result in solicitations and contracts advantageous to the Government. Transportation officers shall provide traffic management assistance throughout the acquisition cycle (see <a href="Subpart%2047_1.html#wp1073617">47.105</a>, Transportation assistance).

47.301-3  Using the Defense Transportation System (DTS).</h3>
<a name="wp1078688"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) All military and civilian agencies shipping, or arranging for the acquisition and shipment by Government contractors, through the use of military-controlled transport or through military transshipment facilities shall follow Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation Part II. This establishes uniform procedures and documents for the generation, documentation, communication, and use of transportation information, thus providing the capability for control of shipments moving in the DTS. DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation Part II has been implemented on a world-wide basis.</p>
<a name="wp1078689"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracting activities are responsible for (1) ensuring that the requirements of the DoD 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation Part II regulation are included in appropriate contracts for all applicable shipments and (2) enforcing these requirements with regard to shipments under their control. This includes requirements relating to documentation, marking, advance notification of shipment dates, and terminal clearances.</p>
<a name="wp1078690"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Contractual documents shall designate a contract administration office (see <a href="Subpart%2042_2.html#wp1081753">42.202</a>(a)) as the contact point to which the contractor will provide necessary information to—

<a name="wp1081999"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Obtain data necessary for shipment marking and freight routing. Contractual documents shall specify that the contractor shall not ship directly to a military air or water port terminal without authorization from the designated contract administration office (see <a href="#wp1078984">47.305-6</a>(f)).

47.302  Place of delivery—f.o.b. point.</h3>
<a name="wp1078694"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The policies and procedures in <a href="#wp1078890">47.304-1</a>, -2, and -3 govern the transportation of supplies from sources in the Contiguous United States (CONUS), except when identifiable costs, nature of the supplies (security, safety, or value), delivery requirements (premium modes of transport, escorts, transit arrangements, and tentative conditions), or other advantages, limitations, or requirements dictate otherwise. The policies and procedures in <a href="#wp1078921">47.304-4</a> govern the transportation of supplies from sources outside CONUS.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078695"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Generally, the contracting officer shall solicit offers, and award contracts, with delivery terms on the basis prescribed in <a href="#wp1078889">47.304</a>. The contracting officer shall document the contract file (see <a href="Subpart%204_8.html#wp1108950">4.801</a>) with justifications for solicitations that do not specify delivery on the basis prescribed in <a href="#wp1078889">47.304</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078696"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c)(1) The place of performance of Government acquisition quality assurance actions and the place of acceptance shall not control the delivery term, except that if acceptance is at destination, transportation shall be f.o.b. destination (see <a href="#wp1078890">47.304-1</a>(f)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1078697"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The fact that transportation is f.o.b. destination does not alone necessitate changing the place of acceptance from origin to destination; and the fact that acceptance is at origin does not necessitate an f.o.b. origin delivery term. Providing for inspection and acceptance at origin (if appropriate under <a href="Subpart%2046_4.html#wp1070252">46.402</a>), in conjunction with an f.o.b. destination term, may be advantageous to both the Government and the contractor. Acceptance of title at origin by the Government permits payment of the contractor, provided the invoice is supported either by a copy of the signed commercial bill of lading (indicating the carrier&rsquo;s receipt of the supplies covered by the invoice for transportation to the particular destination specified in the contract) or by other appropriate evidence of shipment to the particular destination for the contractor&rsquo;s account.

(1) In evaluations of f.o.b. origin offers for large quantities of supplies that contractors normally have in process or storage at intermediate points, contracting officers shall make use of contractors&rsquo; earned commercial transit credits, which are recorded with the carriers. A transit credit represents the transportation costs for a recorded tonnage from the initial point to an intermediate point. The remaining transportation charges from the intermediate point to the Government destination, because they are based on through rates, are frequently lower than the transportation charges that would apply for the same tonnage if the intermediate point were the initial origin point.</p>

(2) If transit credits apply, the contract shall state that the contractor shall ship the goods on prepaid commercial bills of lading, subject to reimbursement by the Government.
