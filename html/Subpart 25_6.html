25.605  Evaluating offers of foreign construction material.</h3>
<a name="wp1078147"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) If the contracting officer has determined that an exception applies because the cost of certain domestic construction material is unreasonable, in accordance with section <a href="#wp1077144">25.604</a>, then the contracting officer shall apply evaluation factors to the offer incorporating the use of such foreign construction material as follows:
      </p>
<a name="wp1078151"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Use an evaluation factor of 25 percent, applied to the total offered price of the contract, if foreign manufactured construction material is incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic construction material requested by the offeror.</p>
<a name="wp1078152"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) In addition, use an evaluation factor of 6 percent applied to the cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material incorporated in the offer based on an exception for unreasonable cost of comparable domestic unmanufactured construction material requested by the offeror.</p>

(3) Total evaluated price = offered price + (.25 x offered price, if (a)(1) applies) + (.06 x cost of foreign unmanufactured construction material, if (a)(2) applies).</p>

(b) If the solicitation specifies award on the basis of factors in addition to cost or price, apply the evaluation factors as specified in paragraph (a) of this section and use the evaluated price in determining the offer that represents the best value to the Government</p>
<a name="wp1077155"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Unless paragraph (b) applies, if two or more offers are equal in price, the contracting officer must give preference to an offer that does not include foreign construction material excepted at the request of the offeror on the basis of unreasonable cost.</p>
<a name="wp1077156"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Offerors also may submit alternate offers based on use of equivalent domestic construction material to avoid possible rejection of the entire offer if the Government determines that an exception permitting use of a particular foreign construction material does not apply.</p>

(e) If the contracting officer awards a contract to an offeror that proposed foreign construction material not listed in the applicable clause in the solicitation (paragraph (b)(3) of <a href="52_223_226.html#wp1184505">52.225-21</a>, or paragraph (b)(3) of <a href="52_223_226.html#wp1184641">52.225-23</a>), the contracting officer must add the excepted materials to the list in the contract clause.

25.606  Postaward determinations. </h3>
<a name="wp1077159"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) If a contractor requests a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute after contract award, the contractor must explain why it could not request the determination before contract award or why the need for such determination otherwise was not reasonably foreseeable. If the contracting officer concludes that the contractor should have made the request before contract award, the contracting officer may deny the request.</p>
<a name="wp1077160"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contracting officer must base evaluation of any request for a determination regarding the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute made after contract award on information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of the applicable clause at <a href="52_223_226.html#wp1184505">52.225-21</a> or <a href="52_223_226.html#wp1184641">52.225-23</a> and/or other readily available information.

(c) If a determination, under <a href="#wp1077812">25.603</a>(a), is made after contract award that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or to the Buy American statute applies, the contracting officer must negotiate adequate consideration and modify the contract to allow use of the foreign construction material.  When the basis for the exception is the unreasonable cost of a domestic construction material, adequate consideration is at least the differential established in <a href="#wp1077150">25.605</a>(a).

25.607  Noncompliance.</h3>
<a name="wp1077163"> </a><p class="pBody">
The contracting officer must—</p>
<a name="wp1077164"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Review allegations of violations of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or Buy American statute;</p>
<a name="wp1077165"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Unless fraud is suspected, notify the contractor of the apparent unauthorized use of foreign construction material and request a reply, to include proposed corrective action; and</p>
<a name="wp1077166"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) If the review reveals that a contractor or subcontractor has used foreign construction material without authorization, take appropriate action, including one or more of the following:</p>
<a name="wp1077167"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Process a determination concerning the inapplicability of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute in accordance with <a href="#wp1077158">25.606</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1077168"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Consider requiring the removal and replacement of the unauthorized foreign construction material.</p>
<a name="wp1077169"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) If removal and replacement of foreign construction material incorporated in a building or work would be impracticable, cause undue delay, or otherwise be detrimental to the interests of the Government, the contracting officer may determine in writing that the foreign construction material need not be removed and replaced. A determination to retain foreign construction material does not constitute a determination that an exception to section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute applies, and this should be stated in the determination. Further, a determination to retain foreign construction material does not affect the Government&rsquo;s right to suspend or debar a contractor, subcontractor, or supplier for violation of section 1605 of the Recovery Act or the Buy American statute, or to exercise other contractual rights and remedies, such as reducing the contract price or terminating the contract for default.</p>
<a name="wp1078497"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) If the noncompliance is sufficiently serious, consider exercising appropriate contractual remedies, such as terminating the contract for default. Also consider preparing and forwarding a report to the agency suspending or debarring official in accordance with subpart <a href="Subpart%209_4.html#wp1083280">9.4</a>. If the noncompliance appears to be fraudulent, refer the matter to other appropriate agency officials, such as the agency&rsquo;s inspector general or the officer responsible for criminal investigation.
