(a) Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t13t16+492+90++%2815%29%20%20AND%20%28%2815%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20">15 U.S.C. 637(a)</a>) established a program that authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to enter into all types of contracts with other agencies and award subcontracts for performing those contracts to firms eligible for program participation. The SBA&rsquo;s subcontractors are referred to as &ldquo;8(a) contractors.&rdquo;
      </p>
<a name="wp1092799"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracts may be awarded to the SBA for performance by eligible 8(a) firms on either a sole source or competitive basis.</p>
<a name="wp1092800"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) When, acting under the authority of the program, the SBA certifies to an agency that the SBA is competent and responsible to perform a specific contract, the contracting officer is authorized, in the contracting officer&rsquo;s discretion, to award the contract to the SBA based upon mutually agreeable terms and conditions.</p>
<a name="wp1092801"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The SBA refers to this program as the 8(a) Business Development (BD) Program.</p>

19.802  Selecting concerns for the 8(a) Program.</h3>
<a name="wp1092806"> </a><p class="pBody">
Selecting concerns for the 8(a) Program is the responsibility of the SBA and is based on the criteria established in 13 CFR 124.101-112.</p>

19.803  Selecting acquisitions for the 8(a) Program.</h3>
<a name="wp1092808"> </a><p class="pBody">
Through their cooperative efforts, the SBA and an agency match the agency&rsquo;s requirements with the capabilities of 8(a) concerns to establish a basis for the agency to contract with the SBA under the program. Selection is initiated in one of three ways—</p>
<a name="wp1092809"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The SBA advises an agency contracting activity through a search letter of an 8(a) firm&rsquo;s capabilities and asks the agency to identify acquisitions to support the firm&rsquo;s business plans. In these instances, the SBA will provide at least the following information in order to enable the agency to match an acquisition to the firm&rsquo;s capabilities:</p>
<a name="wp1092810"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Identification of the concern and its owners.</p>
<a name="wp1092811"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Background information on the concern, including any and all information pertaining to the concern&rsquo;s technical ability and capacity to perform.</p>
<a name="wp1092812"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The firm&rsquo;s present production capacity and related facilities.</p>
<a name="wp1092813"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The extent to which contracting assistance is needed in the present and the future, described in terms that will enable the agency to relate the concern&rsquo;s plans to present and future agency requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1092814"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) If construction is involved, the request shall also include the following:</p>
<a name="wp1092815"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) The concern&rsquo;s capabilities in and qualifications for accomplishing various categories of maintenance, repair, alteration, and construction work in specific categories such as mechanical, electrical, heating and air conditioning, demolition, building, painting, paving, earth work, waterfront work, and general construction work.</p>
<a name="wp1092816"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The concern&rsquo;s capacity in each construction category in terms of estimated dollar value (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>electrical, up to $100,000).
      </p>
<a name="wp1092817"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The SBA identifies a specific requirement for a particular 8(a) firm or firms and asks the agency contracting activity to offer the acquisition to the 8(a) Program for the firm(s). In these instances, in addition to the information in paragraph (a) of this section, the SBA will provide—</p>
<a name="wp1092818"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) A clear identification of the acquisition sought; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>project name or number;
      </p>

(2) A statement as to how any additional needed equipment and real property will be provided in order to ensure that the firm will be fully capable of satisfying the agency&rsquo;s requirements;</p>
<a name="wp1092820"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) If construction, information as to the bonding capability of the firm(s); and</p>
<a name="wp1092821"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Either—</p>
<a name="wp1092822"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) If sole source request—</p>
<a name="wp1092823"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) The reasons why the firm is considered suitable for this particular acquisition; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>previous contracts for the same or similar supply or service; and
      </p>
<a name="wp1092824"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) A statement that the firm is eligible in terms of NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets; or</p>
<a name="wp1092825"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) If competitive, a statement that at least two 8(a) firms are considered capable of satisfying the agency&rsquo;s requirements and a statement that the firms are also eligible in terms of the NAICS code, business support levels, and business activity targets. If requested by the contracting activity, SBA will identify at least two such firms and provide information concerning the firms&rsquo; capabilities.</p>
<a name="wp1092826"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Agencies may also review other proposed acquisitions for the purpose of identifying requirements which may be offered to the SBA. Where agencies independently, or through the self marketing efforts of an 8(a) firm, identify a requirement for the 8(a) Program, they may offer on behalf of a specific 8(a) firm, for the 8(a) Program in general, or for 8(a) competition.</p>

<a name="wp1092829"> </a><p class="pBody">
In determining the extent to which a requirement should be offered in support of the 8(a) Program, the agency should evaluate—</p>

19.804-3  SBA acceptance.</h3>
<a name="wp1092862"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Upon receipt of the contracting agency&rsquo;s offer, the SBA will determine whether to accept the requirement for the 8(a) Program. The SBA&rsquo;s decision whether to accept the requirement will be transmitted to the contracting agency in writing within 10 working days of receipt of the offer if the contract is likely to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and within 2 days of receipt if the contract is at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting agency may grant an extension of these time periods. If SBA does not respond to an offering letter within 10 days, the contracting activity may seek SBA&rsquo;s acceptance through the Associate Administrator.</p>
<a name="wp1092863"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) If the acquisition is accepted as a sole source, the SBA will advise the contracting activity of the 8(a) firm selected for negotiation. Generally, the SBA will accept a contracting activity&rsquo;s recommended source.</p>
<a name="wp1092864"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) For acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, when the contracting activity makes an offer to the 8(a) Program on behalf of a specific 8(a) firm and does not receive a reply to its offer within 2 days, the contracting activity may assume the offer is accepted and proceed with award of an 8(a) contract.</p>
<a name="wp1092865"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) As part of the acceptance process, SBA will review the appropriateness of the NAICS code designation assigned to the requirement by the contracting activity.</p>
<a name="wp1092866"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) SBA will not challenge the NAICS code assigned to the requirement by the contracting activity if it is reasonable, even though other NAICS codes may also be reasonable.</p>
<a name="wp1092867"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) If SBA and the contracting activity are unable to agree on a NAICS code designation for the requirement, SBA may refuse to accept the requirement for the 8(a) Program, appeal the contracting officer&rsquo;s determination to the head of the agency pursuant to <a href="#wp1092916">19.810</a>, or appeal the NAICS code designation to the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals under Subpart C of 13 CFR Part 134.

19.804-4  Repetitive acquisitions.</h3>
<a name="wp1092869"> </a><p class="pBody">
In order for repetitive acquisitions to be awarded through the 8(a) Program, there must be separate offers and acceptances. This allows the SBA to determine—</p>
<a name="wp1092870"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Whether the requirement should be a competitive 8(a) award;</p>

(b) SBA will not accept for award on a sole-source basis any order that would cause the total dollar amount of orders issued under a specific BOA to exceed the competitive threshold amount in <a href="#wp1092883">19.805-1</a>.
      </p>

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this subsection, an acquisition offered to the SBA under the 8(a) Program shall be awarded on the basis of competition limited to eligible 8(a) firms if—</p>

(d) The SBA Associate Administrator for 8(a) Business Development (AA/BD) may approve an agency request for a competitive 8(a) award below the competitive thresholds. Such requests will be approved only on a limited basis and will be primarily granted where technical competitions are appropriate or where a large number of responsible 8(a) firms are available for competition. In determining whether a request to compete below the threshold will be approved, the AA/BD will, in part, consider the extent to which the requesting agency is supporting the 8(a) Program on a noncompetitive basis.

(b) The SBA will determine the eligibility of the firms for award of the contract. Eligibility will be determined by the SBA as of the time of submission of initial offers which include price. Eligibility is based on Section 8(a) Program criteria.</p>
<a name="wp1092895"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) In sealed bid acquisitions, upon receipt of offers, the contracting officer will provide the SBA a copy of the solicitation, the estimated fair market price, and a list of offerors ranked in the order of their standing for award (<em class="cEmphasis">i.e., </em>first low, second low, etc.) with the total evaluated price for each offer, differentiating between basic requirements and any options. The SBA will consider the eligibility of the first low offeror. If the first low offeror is not determined to be eligible, the SBA will consider the eligibility of the next low offeror until an eligible offeror is identified. The SBA will determine the eligibility of the firms and advise the contracting officer within 5 working days after its receipt of the list of bidders. Once eligibility has been established by the SBA, the successful offeror will be determined by the contracting activity in accordance with normal contracting procedures.
      </p>
<a name="wp1092896"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) In negotiated acquisition, the SBA will determine eligibility when the successful offeror has been established by the agency and the contract transmitted for signature unless a referral has been made under <a href="#wp1092914">19.809</a>, in which case the SBA will determine eligibility at that point.

(d) An 8(a) contract, whether in the base or an option year, must be terminated for convenience if the 8(a) concern to which it was awarded transfers ownership or control of the firm or if the contract is transferred or novated for any reason to another firm, unless the Administrator of the SBA waives the requirement for contract termination (13 CFR 124.515). The Administrator may waive the termination requirement only if certain conditions exist. Moreover, a waiver of the requirement for termination is permitted only if the 8(a) firm&rsquo;s request for waiver is made to the SBA prior to the actual relinquishment of ownership or control, except in the case of death or incapacity where the waiver must be submitted within 60 days after such an occurrence. The clauses in the contract entitled &ldquo;Special 8(a) Contract Conditions&rdquo; and &ldquo;Special 8(a) Subcontract Conditions&rdquo; require the SBA and the 8(a) subcontractor to notify the contracting officer when ownership of the firm is being transferred. When the contracting officer receives information that an 8(a) contractor is planning to transfer ownership or control to another firm, the contracting officer must take action immediately to preserve the option of waiving the termination requirement. The contracting officer should determine the timing of the proposed transfer and its effect on contract performance and mission support. If the contracting officer determines that the SBA does not intend to waive the termination requirement, and termination of the contract would severely impair attainment of the agency&rsquo;s program objectives or mission, the contracting officer should immediately notify the SBA in writing that the agency is requesting a waiver. Within 15 business days thereafter, or such longer period as agreed to by the agency and the SBA, the agency head must either confirm or withdraw the request for waiver. Unless a waiver is approved by the SBA, the contracting officer must terminate the contract for convenience upon receipt of a written request by the SBA. This requirement for a convenience termination does not affect the Government&rsquo;s right to terminate for default if the cause for termination of an 8(a) contract is other than the transfer of ownership or control.</p>
