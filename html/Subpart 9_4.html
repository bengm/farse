The existence of a cause for debarment, however, does not necessarily require that the contractor be debarred; the seriousness of the contractor&rsquo;s acts or omissions and any remedial measures or mitigating factors should be considered in making any debarment decision. Before arriving at any debarment decision, the debarring official should consider factors such as the following:
      </p>
<a name="wp1083365"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Whether the contractor had effective standards of conduct and internal control systems in place at the time of the activity which constitutes cause for debarment or had adopted such procedures prior to any Government investigation of the activity cited as a cause for debarment.</p>

(4) Whether the contractor cooperated fully with Government agencies during the investigation and any court or administrative action.</p>

(6) Whether the contractor has taken appropriate disciplinary action against the individuals responsible for the activity which constitutes cause for debarment.</p>

(7) Whether the contractor has implemented or agreed to implement remedial measures, including any identified by the Government.</p>
<a name="wp1083372"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(8) Whether the contractor has instituted or agreed to institute new or revised review and control procedures and ethics training programs.</p>

(2) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing.  In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

(3) <em class="cEmphasis">The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159.</em>  The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

      </p>
<a name="wp1085867"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(4) <em class="cEmphasis">The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.</em>  The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
