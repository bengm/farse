(3) Submission, modification, revision, and withdrawal of proposals.</p>

<a name="wp1144428"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii)(A) Any proposal, modification, or revision received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is &ldquo;late&rdquo; and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—</p>
<a name="wp1144429"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(1) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or</p>

<a name="wp1144431"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(3) It is the only proposal received.</p>
<a name="wp1144432"> </a><p class="pIndented3">

(iii) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>

(iv) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that proposals cannot be received at the office designated for receipt of proposals by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation, the time specified for receipt of proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<a name="wp1144435"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before award. Oral proposals in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

(7) Offerors may submit revised proposals only if requested or allowed by the Contracting Officer.</p>

(e) <em class="cEmphasis">Restriction on disclosure and use of data</em>. Offerors that include in their proposals data that they do not want disclosed to the public for any purpose, or used by the Government except for evaluation purposes, shall—
      </p>
<a name="wp1144443"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Mark the title page with the following legend:</p>
<a name="wp1144444"> </a><p class="pBodyAltNoIndent">
This proposal includes data that shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed—in whole or in part—for any purpose other than to evaluate this proposal. If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of—or in connection with—the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction. The data subject to this restriction are contained in sheets [<em class="cEmphasis">insert numbers or other identification of sheets</em>]; and
      </p>
<a name="wp1144445"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Mark each sheet of data it wishes to restrict with the following legend:</p>

Use or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal.</p>
<a name="wp1144447"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Contract award.</p>
<a name="wp1144448"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The Government intends to award a contract or contracts resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose proposal(s) represents the best value after evaluation in accordance with the factors and subfactors in the solicitation.</p>
<a name="wp1144449"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<a name="wp1144450"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.</p>
<a name="wp1144451"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors (except clarifications as described in FAR <a href="Subpart%2015_3.html#wp1088919">15.306</a>(a)). Therefore, the offeror&rsquo;s initial proposal should contain the offeror&rsquo;s best terms from a cost or price and technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer later determines them to be necessary. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among the most highly rated proposals.
      </p>
<a name="wp1144452"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit cost or prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the proposal.</p>
<a name="wp1144453"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(6) The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards if, after considering the additional administrative costs, it is in the Government&rsquo;s best interest to do so.</p>
<a name="wp1144454"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(7) Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.</p>
<a name="wp1144455"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(8) The Government may determine that a proposal is unacceptable if the prices proposed are materially unbalanced between line items or subline items. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly overstated or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. A proposal may be rejected if the Contracting Officer determines that the lack of balance poses an unacceptable risk to the Government.</p>
<a name="wp1144456"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(9) If a cost realism analysis is performed, cost realism may be considered by the source selection authority in evaluating performance or schedule risk.</p>
<a name="wp1144457"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(10) A written award or acceptance of proposal mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time specified in the proposal shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.</p>
<a name="wp1144458"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(11) If a post-award debriefing is given to requesting offerors, the Government shall disclose the following information, if applicable:</p>
<a name="wp1144459"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) The agency&rsquo;s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed offeror&rsquo;s offer.</p>
<a name="wp1144460"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful and the debriefed offeror and past performance information on the debriefed offeror.</p>
<a name="wp1144461"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.</p>
<a name="wp1144462"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) A summary of the rationale for award.</p>
<a name="wp1144463"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.</p>
<a name="wp1144464"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency.</p>
