&ldquo;Applied research&rdquo; means the effort that (a) normally follows basic research, but may not be severable from the related basic research; (b) attempts to determine and exploit the potential of scientific discoveries or improvements in technology, materials, processes, methods, devices, or techniques; and (c) attempts to advance the state of the art. When being used by contractors in cost principle applications, this term does not include efforts whose principal aim is the design, development, or testing of specific items or services to be considered for sale; these efforts are within the definition of &ldquo;development,&rdquo; given below.</p>
<a name="wp1085082"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Development,&rdquo; as used in this part, means the systematic use of scientific and technical knowledge in the design, development, testing, or evaluation of a potential new product or service (or of an improvement in an existing product or service) to meet specific performance requirements or objectives. It includes the functions of design engineering, prototyping, and engineering testing; it excludes subcontracted technical effort that is for the sole purpose of developing an additional source for an existing product.</p>
<a name="wp1085083"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Recoupment,&rdquo; as used in this part, means the recovery by the Government of Government-funded nonrecurring costs from contractors that sell, lease, or license the resulting products or technology to buyers other than the Federal Government.</p>

35.002  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1085085"> </a><p class="pBody">
The primary purpose of contracted R&amp;D programs is to advance scientific and technical knowledge and apply that knowledge to the extent necessary to achieve agency and national goals. Unlike contracts for supplies and services, most R&amp;D contracts are directed toward objectives for which the work or methods cannot be precisely described in advance. It is difficult to judge the probabilities of success or required effort for technical approaches, some of which offer little or no early assurance of full success. The contracting process shall be used to encourage the best sources from the scientific and industrial community to become involved in the program and must provide an environment in which the work can be pursued with reasonable flexibility and minimum administrative burden.</p>

<a name="wp1085091"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) In order to obtain a broad base of the best contractor sources from the scientific and industrial community, agencies must, in addition to following the requirements of <a href="FARTOCP05.html#wp290921">Part 5</a>, continually search for and develop information on sources (including small business concerns) competent to perform R&amp;D work. These efforts should include—
      </p>
<a name="wp1085092"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Early identification and publication of agency R&amp;D needs and requirements, including publicizing through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) (see <a href="FARTOCP05.html#wp290921">Part 5</a>);
      </p>
<a name="wp1085093"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Cooperation among technical personnel, contracting officers, and Government small business personnel early in the acquisition process; and</p>
<a name="wp1085094"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Providing agency R&amp;D points of contact for potential sources.</p>
<a name="wp1085095"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) See <a href="Subpart%209_7.html#wp1077644">Subpart 9.7</a> for information regarding R&amp;D pools and <a href="Subpart%209_6.html#wp1077565">Subpart 9.6</a> for teaming arrangements.
      </p>
<a name="wp1085096"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
35.005  Work statement.</h3>
<a name="wp1085097"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A clear and complete work statement concerning the area of exploration (for basic research) or the end objectives (for development and applied research) is essential. The work statement should allow contractors freedom to exercise innovation and creativity. Work statements must be individually tailored by technical and contracting personnel to attain the desired degree of flexibility for contractor creativity and the objectives of the R&amp;D.</p>
<a name="wp1085098"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) In basic research the emphasis is on achieving specified objectives and knowledge rather than on achieving predetermined end results prescribed in a statement of specific performance characteristics. This emphasis applies particularly during the early or conceptual phases of the R&amp;D effort.</p>
<a name="wp1085099"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) In reviewing work statements, contracting officers should ensure that language suitable for a level-of-effort approach, which requires the furnishing of technical effort and a report on the results, is not intermingled with language suitable for a task-completion approach, which often requires the development of a tangible end item designed to achieve specific performance characteristics. The wording of the work statement should also be consistent with the type and form of contract to be negotiated (see <a href="Subpart%2016_2.html#wp1091206">16.207</a> and <a href="Subpart%2016_3.html#wp1077371">16.306</a>(d)). For example, the work statement for a cost-reimbursement contract promising the contractor&rsquo;s best efforts for a fixed term would be phrased differently than a work statement for a cost-reimbursement completion contract promising the contractor&rsquo;s best efforts for a defined task. Differences between work statements for fixed-price contracts and cost-reimbursement contracts should be even clearer.
      </p>
<a name="wp1085100"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) In preparing work statements, technical and contracting personnel shall consider and, as appropriate, provide in the solicitation—</p>
<a name="wp1085101"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) A statement of the area of exploration, tasks to be performed, and objectives of the research or development effort;</p>
<a name="wp1085102"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Background information helpful to a clear understanding of the objective or requirement (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>any known phenomena, techniques, methodology, or results of related work);
      </p>
<a name="wp1085103"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Information on factors such as personnel, environment, and interfaces that may constrain the results of the effort;</p>
<a name="wp1085104"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Reporting requirements and information on any additional items that the contractor is required to furnish (at specified intervals) as the work progresses;</p>
<a name="wp1085105"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) The type and form of contract contemplated by the Government and, for level-of-effort work statements, an estimate of applicable professional and technical effort involved; and</p>
<a name="wp1085106"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(6) Any other considerations peculiar to the work to be performed; for example, any design-to-cost requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1085107"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
35.006  Contracting methods and contract type.</h3>
<a name="wp1085108"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) In R&amp;D acquisitions, the precise specifications necessary for sealed bidding are generally not available, thus making negotiation necessary. However, the use of negotiation in R&amp;D contracting does not change the obligation to comply with <a href="FARTOCP06.html#wp280339">Part 6</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1085109"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Selecting the appropriate contract type is the responsibility of the contracting officer. However, because of the importance of technical considerations in R&amp;D, the choice of contract type should be made after obtaining the recommendations of technical personnel. Although the Government ordinarily prefers fixed-price arrangements in contracting, this preference applies in R&amp;D contracting only to the extent that goals, objectives, specifications, and cost estimates are sufficient to permit such a preference. The precision with which the goals, performance objectives, and specifications for the work can be defined will largely determine the type of contract employed. The contract type must be selected to fit the work required.</p>
<a name="wp1085110"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Because the absence of precise specifications and difficulties in estimating costs with accuracy (resulting in a lack of confidence in cost estimates) normally precludes using fixed-price contracting for R&amp;D, the use of cost-reimbursement contracts is usually appropriate (see <a href="Subpart%2016_3.html#wp1077348">Subpart 16.3</a>). The nature of development work often requires a cost-reimbursement completion arrangement (see <a href="Subpart%2016_3.html#wp1077371">16.306</a>(d)). When the use of cost and performance incentives is desirable and practicable, fixed-price incentive and cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts should be considered in that order of preference.
      </p>
<a name="wp1085111"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) When levels of effort can be specified in advance, a short-duration fixed-price contract may be useful for developing system design concepts, resolving potential problems, and reducing Government risks. Fixed-price contracting may also be used in minor projects when the objectives of the research are well defined and there is sufficient confidence in the cost estimate for price negotiations. (See <a href="Subpart%2016_2.html#wp1091206">16.207</a>.)
      </p>
<a name="wp1085112"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Projects having production requirements as a follow-on to R&amp;D efforts normally should progress from cost-reimbursement contracts to fixed-price contracts as designs become more firmly established, risks are reduced, and production tooling, equipment, and processes are developed and proven. When possible, a final commitment to undertake specific product development and testing should be avoided until—</p>
<a name="wp1085113"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Preliminary exploration and studies have indicated a high degree of probability that development is feasible and</p>
<a name="wp1085114"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The Government has determined both its minimum requirements and desired objectives for product performance and schedule completion.</p>
<a name="wp1085115"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
35.007  Solicitations.</h3>
<a name="wp1085116"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The submission and subsequent evaluation of an inordinate number of R&amp;D proposals from sources lacking appropriate qualifications is costly and time-consuming to both industry and the Government. Therefore, contracting officers should initially distribute solicitations only to sources technically qualified to perform research or development in the specific field of science or technology involved. Cognizant technical personnel should recommend potential sources that appear qualified, as a result of—</p>
<a name="wp1085117"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Present and past performance of similar work;</p>
<a name="wp1085118"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Professional stature and reputation;</p>
<a name="wp1085119"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Relative position in a particular field of endeavor;</p>
<a name="wp1085120"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Ability to acquire and retain the professional and technical capability, including facilities, required to perform the work; and</p>
<a name="wp1085121"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Other relevant factors.</p>
<a name="wp1085122"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Proposals generally shall be solicited from technically qualified sources, including sources that become known as a result of synopses or other means of publicizing requirements. If it is not practicable to initially solicit all apparently qualified sources, only a reasonable number need be solicited. In the interest of competition, contracting officers shall furnish copies of the solicitation to other apparently qualified sources.</p>
<a name="wp1085123"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Solicitations shall require offerors to describe their technical and management approach, identify technical uncertainties, and make specific proposals for the resolution of any uncertainties. The solicitation should require offerors to include in the proposal any planned subcontracting of scientific or technical work (see <a href="#wp1085143">35.009</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1085124"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Solicitations may require that proposals be organized so that the technical portions can be efficiently evaluated by technical personnel (see <a href="Subpart%2015_2.html#wp1125395">15.204-5</a>(b)). Solicitation and evaluation of proposals should be planned to minimize offerors&rsquo; and Government expense.
      </p>
<a name="wp1085125"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) R&amp;D solicitations should contain evaluation factors to be used to determine the most technically competent (see <a href="Subpart%2015_3.html#wp1088883">15.304</a>), such as—
      </p>
<a name="wp1085126"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The offeror&rsquo;s understanding of the scope of the work;</p>
<a name="wp1085127"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The approach proposed to accomplish the scientific and technical objectives of the contract or the merit of the ideas or concepts proposed;</p>
<a name="wp1085128"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The availability and competence of experienced engineering, scientific, or other technical personnel;</p>
<a name="wp1085129"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The offeror&rsquo;s experience;</p>
<a name="wp1085130"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Pertinent novel ideas in the specific branch of science and technology involved; and</p>
<a name="wp1085131"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(6) The availability, from any source, of necessary research, test, laboratory, or shop facilities.</p>
<a name="wp1085132"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) In addition to evaluation factors for technical competence, the contracting officer shall consider, as appropriate, management capability (including cost management techniques), experience and past performance, subcontracting practices, and any other significant evaluation criteria (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>unrealistically low cost estimates in proposals for cost-reimbursement or fixed-price incentive contracts). Although cost or price is not normally the controlling factor in selecting a contractor to perform R&amp;D, it should not be disregarded in arriving at a selection that best satisfies the Government&rsquo;s requirement at a fair and reasonable cost.
      </p>
<a name="wp1085133"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) The contracting officer should ensure that potential offerors fully understand the details of the work, especially the Government interpretation of the work statement. If the effort is complex, the contracting officer should provide potential offerors an opportunity to comment on the details of the requirements as contained in the work statement, the contract Schedule, and any related specifications. This may be done at a preproposal conference (see <a href="Subpart%2015_2.html#wp1125233">15.201</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1085134"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) If it is appropriate to do so, solicitations should permit offerors to propose an alternative contract type (see <a href="Subpart%2016_1.html#wp1085506">16.103</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1086894"> </a><p class="pBody">
(i) In circumstances when a concern has a new idea or product to discuss that incorporates the results of independent R&amp;D work funded by the concern in the private sector and is of interest to the Government, there should be no hesitancy to discuss it; however, the concern should be warned that the Government will not be obligated by the discussion. Under such circumstances, it may be appropriate to negotiate directly with the concern without competition. Also, see <a href="Subpart%2015_6.html#wp1104869">Subpart 15.6</a> concerning unsolicited proposals.
      </p>
<a name="wp1086895"> </a><p class="pBody">
(j) The Government may issue an exploratory request to determine the existence of ideas or prior work in a specific field of research. Any such request shall clearly state that it does not impose any obligation on the Government or signify a firm intention to enter into a contract.</p>

35.008  Evaluation for award.</h3>
<a name="wp1085138"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Generally, an R&amp;D contract should be awarded to that organization, including any educational institution, that proposes the best ideas or concepts and has the highest competence in the specific field of science or technology involved. However, an award should not be made to obtain capabilities that exceed those needed for successful performance of the work.</p>
<a name="wp1085139"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) In R&amp;D contracting, precise specifications are ordinarily not available. The contracting officer should therefore take special care in reviewing the solicitation evaluation factors to assure that they are properly presented and consistent with the solicitation.</p>
<a name="wp1085140"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) When a small business concern would otherwise be selected for award but is considered not responsible, the SBA Certificate of Competency procedure shall be followed (see <a href="Subpart%2019_6.html#wp1089863">Subpart 19.6</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1086921"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The contracting officer should use the procedures in <a href="Subpart%2015_5.html#wp1095192">Subpart 15.5</a> to notify and debrief offerors.
      </p>
<a name="wp1086922"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) It is important to evaluate a proposed contractor&rsquo;s cost or price estimate, not only to determine whether the estimate is reasonable but also to provide valuable insight into the offeror&rsquo;s understanding of the project, perception of risks, and ability to organize and perform the work. Cost or price analysis, as appropriate (see <a href="Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1225484">15.404-1</a>(c)), is a useful tool.

35.009  Subcontracting research and development effort.</h3>
<a name="wp1085144"> </a><p class="pBody">
Since the selection of R&amp;D contractors is substantially based on the best scientific and technological sources, it is important that the contractor not subcontract technical or scientific work without the contracting officer&rsquo;s advance knowledge. During the negotiation of a cost-reimbursement R&amp;D contract, the contracting officer shall obtain complete information concerning the contractor&rsquo;s plans for subcontracting any portion of the experimental, research, or development effort (see also <a href="#wp1085115">35.007</a>(c)). Also, when negotiating a fixed-price contract, the contracting officer should evaluate this information and may obtain an agreement that protects the Government&rsquo;s interests. The clause at <a href="52_241_244.html#wp1129081">52.244-2</a>, Subcontracts, prescribed for certain types of contracts at <a href="Subpart%2044_2.html#wp1075060">44.204</a>(a), requires the contracting officer&rsquo;s prior approval for the placement of certain subcontracts.

<a name="wp1085201"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) An FFRDC meets some special long-term research or development need which cannot be met as effectively by existing in-house or contractor resources. FFRDC&rsquo;s enable agencies to use private sector resources to accomplish tasks that are integral to the mission and operation of the sponsoring agency. An FFRDC, in order to discharge its responsibilities to the sponsoring agency, has access, beyond that which is common to the normal contractual relationship, to Government and supplier data, including sensitive and proprietary data, and to employees and installations equipment and real property. The FFRDC is required to conduct its business in a manner befitting its special relationship with the Government, to operate in the public interest with objectivity and independence, to be free from organizational conflicts of interest, and to have full disclosure of its affairs to the sponsoring agency. It is not the Government&rsquo;s intent that an FFRDC use its privileged information or access to installations equipment and real property to compete with the private sector. However, an FFRDC may perform work for other than the sponsoring agency under the Economy Act, or other applicable legislation, when the work is not otherwise available from the private sector.</p>
<a name="wp1085202"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) FFRDC&rsquo;s are operated, managed, and/or administered by either a university or consortium of universities, other not-for-profit or nonprofit organization, or an industrial firm, as an autonomous organization or as an identifiable separate operating unit of a parent organization.</p>
<a name="wp1085203"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Long-term relationships between the Government and FFRDC&rsquo;s are encouraged in order to provide the continuity that will attract high-quality personnel to the FFRDC. This relationship should be of a type to encourage the FFRDC to maintain currency in its field(s) of expertise, maintain its objectivity and independence, preserve its familiarity with the needs of its sponsor(s), and provide a quick response capability.</p>
