(a) Agencies shall maintain sound relations with industry and labor to ensure (1) prompt receipt of information involving labor relations that may adversely affect the Government acquisition process and (2) that the Government obtains needed supplies and services without delay. All matters regarding labor relations shall be handled in accordance with agency procedures.</p>
<a name="wp1114602"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b)(1) Agencies shall remain impartial concerning any dispute between labor and contractor management and not undertake the conciliation, mediation, or arbitration of a labor dispute. To the extent practicable, agencies should ensure that the parties to the dispute use all available methods for resolving the dispute, including the services of the National Labor Relations Board, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the National Mediation Board and other appropriate Federal, State, local, or private agencies.</p>
<a name="wp1114598"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

(c) Agencies should, when practicable, exchange information concerning labor matters with other affected agencies to ensure a uniform Government approach concerning a particular plant or labor-management dispute.</p>
<a name="wp1113344"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Agencies should take other actions concerning labor relations problems to the extent consistent with their acquisition responsibilities. For example, agencies should—</p>
<a name="wp1113345"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Notify the agency responsible for conciliation, mediation, arbitration, or other related action of the existence of any labor dispute affecting or threatening to affect agency acquisition programs;</p>
<a name="wp1113346"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Furnish to the parties to a dispute factual information pertinent to the dispute&rsquo;s potential or actual adverse impact on these programs, to the extent consistent with security regulations; and</p>
<a name="wp1113347"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Seek a voluntary agreement between management and labor, notwithstanding the continuance of the dispute, to permit uninterrupted acquisition of supplies and services. This shall only be done, however, if the attempt to obtain voluntary agreement does not involve the agency in the merits of the dispute and only after consultation with the agency responsible for conciliation, mediation, arbitration, or other related action.</p>
<a name="wp1113348"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) The head of the contracting activity may designate programs or requirements for which it is necessary that contractors be required to notify the Government of actual or potential labor disputes that are delaying or threaten to delay the timely contract performance (see <a href="#wp1113408">22.103-5</a>(a)).

22.101-2  Contract pricing and administration.</h3>
<a name="wp1113350"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Contractor labor policies and compensation practices, whether or not included in labor-management agreements, are not acceptable bases for allowing costs in cost-reimbursement contracts or for recognition of costs in pricing fixed-price contracts if they result in unreasonable costs to the Government. For a discussion of allowable costs resulting from labor-management agreements, see <a href="Subpart%2031_2.html#wp1095659">31.205-6</a>(b).
      </p>
<a name="wp1113351"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Labor disputes may cause work stoppages that delay the performance of Government contracts. Contracting officers shall impress upon contractors that each contractor shall be held accountable for reasonably avoidable delays. Standard contract clauses dealing with default, excusable delays, etc., do not relieve contractors or subcontractors from the responsibility for delays that are within the contractors&rsquo; or their subcontractors&rsquo; control. A delay caused by a strike that the contractor or subcontractor could not reasonably prevent can be excused; however, it cannot be excused beyond the point at which a reasonably diligent contractor or subcontractor could have acted to end the strike by actions such as—</p>
<a name="wp1113352"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Filing a charge with the National Labor Relations Board to permit the Board to seek injunctive relief in court;</p>

(3) Using private boards or organizations to settle disputes.</p>
<a name="wp1113355"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Strikes normally result in changing patterns of cost incurrence and therefore may have an impact on the allowability of costs for cost-reimbursement contracts or for recognition of costs in pricing fixed-price contracts. Certain costs may increase because of strikes; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>guard services and attorney&rsquo;s fees. Other costs incurred during a strike may not fluctuate (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>&ldquo;fixed costs&rdquo; such as rent and depreciation), but because of reduced production, their proportion of the unit cost of items produced increases. All costs incurred during strikes shall be carefully examined to ensure recognition of only those costs necessary for performing the contract in accordance with the Government&rsquo;s essential interest.
      </p>
<a name="wp1113356"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) If, during a labor dispute, the inspectors&rsquo; safety is not endangered, the normal functions of inspection at the plant of a Government contractor shall be continued without regard to the existence of a labor dispute, strike, or picket line.</p>

22.101-3  Reporting labor disputes.</h3>

The office administering the contract shall report, in accordance with agency procedures, any potential or actual labor disputes that may interfere with performing any contracts under its cognizance. If a contract contains the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1147459">52.222-1</a>, Notice to the Government of Labor Disputes, the contractor also must report any actual or potential dispute that may delay contract performance.

<a name="wp1113361"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Determine whether removal of items is in the Government&rsquo;s interest. Normally the determining factor is the critical needs of an agency program.</p>

(3) Obtain appropriate approvals from within the agency.</p>
