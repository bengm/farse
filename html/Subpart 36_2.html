<a name="wp1084275"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The Government shall also reject an offer if its prices are within statutory limitations only because it is materially unbalanced. An offer is unbalanced if its prices are significantly less than cost for some work, and overstated for other work.</p>

36.207  Pricing fixed-price construction contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1084279"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Generally, firm-fixed-price contracts shall be used to acquire construction. They may be priced—</p>

(4) Offerors would have to expend unusual effort to develop adequate estimates.</p>
<a name="wp1084288"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Fixed-price contracts with economic price adjustment may be used if such a provision is customary in contracts for the type of work being acquired, or when omission of an adjustment provision would preclude a significant number of firms from submitting offers or would result in offerors including unwarranted contingencies in proposed prices.</p>
<a name="wp1084289"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
36.208  Concurrent performance of firm-fixed-price and other types of construction contracts.</h3>

The contracting officer should make appropriate arrangements for prospective offerors to inspect the work site and to have the opportunity to examine data available to the Government which may provide information concerning the performance of the work, such as boring samples, original boring logs, and records and plans of previous construction. The data should be assembled in one place and made available for examination. The solicitation should notify offerors of the time and place for the site inspection and data examination. If it is not feasible for offerors to inspect the site or examine the data on their own, the solicitation should also designate an individual who will show the site or data to the offerors. Significant site information and the data should be made available to all offerors in the same manner, including information regarding any utilities to be furnished during construction. A record should be kept of the identity and affiliation of all offerors&rsquo; representatives who inspect the site or examine the data.</p>

36.211  Distribution of advance notices and solicitations.</h3>
<a name="wp1084296"> </a><p class="pBody">
Advance notices and solicitations should be distributed to reach as many prospective offerors as practicable. Contracting officers may send notices and solicitations to organizations that maintain, without charge to the public, display rooms for the benefit of prospective offerors, subcontractors, and material suppliers.
