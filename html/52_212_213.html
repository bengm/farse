(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.</p>
<a name="wp1179144"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.</p>
<a name="wp1179145"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is &ldquo;late&rdquo; and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—</p>
<a name="wp1179146"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or</p>
<a name="wp1179147"> </a><p class="pIndented3">

(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.</p>
<a name="wp1179149"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>

(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.</p>
<a name="wp1179151"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<a name="wp1204552"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.</p>
<a name="wp1179153"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) <em class="cEmphasis">Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids</em>). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror&rsquo;s initial offer should contain the offeror&rsquo;s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

(h) <em class="cEmphasis">Multiple awards</em>. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations.
