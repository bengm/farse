41.201  Policy.</h3>
<a name="wp1074932"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Subject to paragraph (d) of this section, it is the policy of the Federal Government that agencies obtain required utility services from sources of supply which are most advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, reliability, or service.</p>
<a name="wp1074933"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Except for acquisitions at or below the simplified acquisition threshold, agencies shall acquire utility services by a bilateral written contract, which must include the clauses required by <a href="Subpart%2041_5.html#wp1080612">41.501</a>, regardless of whether rates or terms and conditions of service are fixed or adjusted by a regulatory body. Agencies may not use the utility supplier&rsquo;s forms and clauses to avoid the inclusion of provisions and clauses required by <a href="Subpart%2041_5.html#wp1080612">41.501</a> or by statute. (See <a href="#wp1074945">41.202</a>(c) for procedures to be used when the supplier refuses to execute a written contract.)
      </p>
<a name="wp1074934"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Specific operating and management details, such as procedures for internal agency contract assistance and review, delegations of authority, and approval thresholds, may be prescribed by an individual agency subject to compliance with applicable statutes and regulations.</p>
<a name="wp1074935"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d)(1) Section 8093 of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-202, provides that none of the funds appropriated by that Act or any other Act with respect to any fiscal year by any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, may be used for the purchase of electricity by the Government in any manner that is inconsistent with state law governing the providing of electric utility service, including state utility commission rulings and electric utility franchises or service territories established pursuant to state statute, state regulation, or state-approved territorial agreements.</p>

41.202  Procedures.</h3>
<a name="wp1074946"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Prior to executing a utility service contract, the contracting officer shall comply with <a href="FARTOCP06.html#wp280339">Parts 6</a> and <a href="FARTOCP07.html#wp273907">7</a> and subsections <a href="#wp1074931">41.201</a>(d) and (e) of this part. In accordance with <a href="FARTOCP06.html#wp280339">Parts 6</a> and <a href="FARTOCP07.html#wp273907">7</a>, agencies shall conduct market surveys and perform acquisition planning in order to promote and provide for full and open competition provided that the contracting officer determines that any resultant contract would not be inconsistent with applicable state law governing the provision of electric utility services. If competition for an entire utility service is not available, the market survey may be used to determine the availability of competitive sources for certain portions of the requirement. The scope of the term &ldquo;entire utility service&rdquo; includes the provision of the utility service capacity, energy, water, sewage, transportation, standby or back-up service, transmission and/or distribution service, quality assurance, system reliability, system operation and maintenance, metering, and billing.

(c) When a utility supplier refuses to execute a tendered contract as outlined in <a href="#wp1074931">41.201</a>(b), the agency shall obtain a written definite and final refusal signed by a corporate officer or other responsible official of the supplier (or if unobtainable, document any unwritten refusal) and transmit this document, along with statements of the reasons for the refusal and the record of negotiations, to GSA at the address specified at <a href="Subpart%2041_3.html#wp1074508">41.301</a>(a).

41.204  GSA areawide contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1074966"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Purpose</em>. GSA enters into areawide contracts (see <a href="Subpart%2041_1.html#wp1074547">41.101</a>) for use by Federal agencies. Areawide contracts provide a pre-established contractual vehicle for ordering utility services under the conditions in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
      </p>
<a name="wp1074967"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Features.</p>
<a name="wp1074968"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Areawide contracts generally provide for ordering utility service at rates approved and/or established by a regulatory body and published in a tariff or rate schedule. However, agencies are permitted to negotiate other rates and terms and conditions of service with the supplier (see paragraph (c) of this section). Rates other than those published may require the approval of the regulatory body.</p>
<a name="wp1074969"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Areawide contracts are negotiated with utility service suppliers for the provision of service within the supplier&rsquo;s franchise territory or service area.</p>
<a name="wp1074970"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Due to the regulated nature of the utility industry, as well as statutory restrictions associated with the procurement of electricity (see <a href="#wp1074931">41.201</a>(d)), competition is typically not available within the entire geographical area covered by an areawide contract, although it may be available at specific locations within the utility&rsquo;s service area. When competing suppliers are available, the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section apply.
      </p>
<a name="wp1074971"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Procedures for obtaining service.</p>
<a name="wp1074972"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Any Federal agency having a requirement for utility services within an area covered by an areawide contract shall acquire services under that areawide contract unless—</p>
<a name="wp1074973"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Service is available from more than one supplier, or</p>
<a name="wp1074974"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The head of the contracting activity or designee otherwise determines that use of the areawide contract is not advantageous to the Government. If service is available from more than one supplier, service shall be acquired using competitive acquisition procedures (see <a href="#wp1074945">41.202</a>(a)). The determination required by paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section shall be documented in the contract file with an information copy furnished to GSA at the address in <a href="Subpart%2041_3.html#wp1074508">41.301</a>(a).
      </p>
<a name="wp1074975"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Each areawide contract includes an authorization form for ordering service, connection, disconnection, or change in service. Upon execution of an authorization by the contracting officer and utility supplier, the utility supplier is required to furnish services, without further negotiation, at the current, applicable published or unpublished rates, unless other rates, and/or terms and conditions are separately negotiated by the Federal agency with the supplier.</p>
<a name="wp1074976"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer shall execute the Authorization, and attach it to a <a href="FormsStandard6.html#wp1189341">Standard Form (SF) 26</a>, Award/Contract, along with any modifications such as connection charges, special facilities, or service arrangements. The contracting officer shall also attach any specific fiscal, operational, and administrative requirements of the agency, applicable rate schedules, technical information and detailed maps or drawings of delivery points, details on Government ownership, maintenance, or repair of facilities, and other information deemed necessary to fully define the service conditions in the Authorization/contract.
