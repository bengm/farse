16.500  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1093135"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for making awards of indefinite-delivery contracts and establishes a preference for making multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts.</p>
<a name="wp1093136"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) This subpart does not limit the use of other than competitive procedures authorized by <a href="FARTOCP06.html#wp280339">Part 6</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1093137"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Nothing in this subpart restricts the authority of the General Services Administration (GSA) to enter into schedule, multiple award, or task or delivery order contracts under any other provision of law. Therefore, GSA regulations and the coverage for the Federal Supply Schedule program in <a href="Subpart%208_4.html#wp1089480">subpart 8.4</a> and <a href="FARTOCP38.html#wp223485">Part 38</a> take precedence over this subpart.
      </p>
<a name="wp1093138"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The statutory multiple award preference implemented by this subpart does not apply to architect-engineer contracts subject to the procedures in <a href="Subpart%2036_6.html#wp1075548">subpart 36.6</a>. However, agencies are not precluded from making multiple awards for architect-engineer services using the procedures in this subpart, provided the selection of contractors and placement of orders are consistent with <a href="Subpart%2036_6.html#wp1075548">subpart 36.6</a>.

<a name="wp1093140"> </a><p class="pBody">
As used in this subpart—</p>
<a name="wp1093141"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Delivery-order contract&rdquo; means a contract for supplies that does not procure or specify a firm quantity of supplies (other than a minimum or maximum quantity) and that provides for the issuance of orders for the delivery of supplies during the period of the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1093142"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Task-order contract&rdquo; means a contract for services that does not procure or specify a firm quantity of services (other than a minimum or maximum quantity) and that provides for the issuance of orders for the performance of tasks during the period of the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1093143"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
16.501-2  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1093144"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) There are three types of indefinite-delivery contracts: definite-quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and indefinite-quantity contracts. The appropriate type of indefinite-delivery contract may be used to acquire supplies and/or services when the exact times and/or exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of contract award. Pursuant to <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">10 U.S.C. 2304d</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 4101</a>, requirements contracts and indefinite-quantity contracts are also known as delivery-order contracts or task-order contracts.
      </p>
<a name="wp1093145"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The various types of indefinite-delivery contracts offer the following advantages:</p>
<a name="wp1093146"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) All three types permit—</p>
<a name="wp1093147"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Government stocks to be maintained at minimum levels; and</p>
<a name="wp1093148"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Direct shipment to users.</p>
<a name="wp1093149"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Indefinite-quantity contracts and requirements contracts also permit—</p>
<a name="wp1093150"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Flexibility in both quantities and delivery scheduling; and</p>
<a name="wp1093151"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Ordering of supplies or services after requirements materialize.</p>
<a name="wp1093152"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Indefinite-quantity contracts limit the Government&rsquo;s obligation to the minimum quantity specified in the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1093153"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Requirements contracts may permit faster deliveries when production lead time is involved, because contractors are usually willing to maintain limited stocks when the Government will obtain all of its actual purchase requirements from the contractor.</p>
<a name="wp1094423"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Indefinite-delivery contracts may provide for any appropriate cost or pricing arrangement under <a href="FARTOCP16.html#wp226194">Part 16</a>. Cost or pricing arrangements that provide for an estimated quantity of supplies or services (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>estimated number of labor hours) must comply with the appropriate procedures of this subpart.

16.503  Requirements contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1093161"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Description</em>. A requirements contract provides for filling all actual purchase requirements of designated Government activities for supplies or services during a specified contract period (from one contractor), with deliveries or performance to be scheduled by placing orders with the contractor.
      </p>
<a name="wp1093162"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) For the information of offerors and contractors, the contracting officer shall state a realistic estimated total quantity in the solicitation and resulting contract. This estimate is not a representation to an offeror or contractor that the estimated quantity will be required or ordered, or that conditions affecting requirements will be stable or normal. The contracting officer may obtain the estimate from records of previous requirements and consumption, or by other means, and should base the estimate on the most current information available.</p>
<a name="wp1094762"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The contract shall state, if feasible, the maximum limit of the contractor&rsquo;s obligation to deliver and the Government&rsquo;s obligation to order. The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that the Government may order under each individual order and the maximum that it may order during a specified period of time.</p>

(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Application</em>. 
      </p>
<a name="wp1094766"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

<a name="wp1094777"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) No requirements contract in an amount estimated to exceed $112 million (including all options) may be awarded to a single source unless a determination is executed in accordance with <a href="#wp1093169">16.504</a>(c)(1)(ii)(D).

(c) <em class="cEmphasis">Government property furnished for repair</em>. When a requirements contract is used to acquire work (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>repair, modification, or overhaul) on existing items of Government property, the contracting officer shall specify in the Schedule that failure of the Government to furnish such items in the amounts or quantities described in the Schedule as &ldquo;estimated&rdquo; or &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; will not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment in price under the Government Property clause of the contract.
      </p>

(d) Limitations on use of requirements contracts for advisory and assistance services.</p>

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, no solicitation for a requirements contract for advisory and assistance services in excess of three years and $13.5 million (including all options) may be issued unless the contracting officer or other official designated by the head of the agency determines in writing that the services required are so unique or highly specialized that it is not practicable to make multiple awards using the procedures in <a href="#wp1093169">16.504</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1093168"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The limitation in paragraph (d)(1) of this section is not applicable to an acquisition of supplies or services that includes the acquisition of advisory and assistance services, if the contracting officer or other official designated by the head of the agency determines that the advisory and assistance services are necessarily incident to, and not a significant component of, the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1093169"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
16.504  Indefinite-quantity contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1093170"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Description</em>. An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services during a fixed period. The Government places orders for individual requirements. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as dollar values.
      </p>
<a name="wp1093171"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The contract must require the Government to order and the contractor to furnish at least a stated minimum quantity of supplies or services. In addition, if ordered, the contractor must furnish any additional quantities, not to exceed the stated maximum. The contracting officer should establish a reasonable maximum quantity based on market research, trends on recent contracts for similar supplies or services, survey of potential users, or any other rational basis.</p>
<a name="wp1093172"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) To ensure that the contract is binding, the minimum quantity must be more than a nominal quantity, but it should not exceed the amount that the Government is fairly certain to order.</p>
<a name="wp1093173"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contract may also specify maximum or minimum quantities that the Government may order under each task or delivery order and the maximum that it may order during a specific period of time.</p>
<a name="wp1093174"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) A solicitation and contract for an indefinite quantity must—</p>
<a name="wp1093175"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Specify the period of the contract, including the number of options and the period for which the Government may extend the contract under each option;</p>
<a name="wp1093176"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Specify the total minimum and maximum quantity of supplies or services the Government will acquire under the contract;</p>
<a name="wp1093177"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Include a statement of work, specifications, or other description, that reasonably describes the general scope, nature, complexity, and purpose of the supplies or services the Government will acquire under the contract in a manner that will enable a prospective offeror to decide whether to submit an offer;</p>
<a name="wp1093178"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) State the procedures that the Government will use in issuing orders, including the ordering media, and, if multiple awards may be made, state the procedures and selection criteria that the Government will use to provide awardees a fair opportunity to be considered for each order (see <a href="#wp1095799">16.505</a>(b)(1));
      </p>
<a name="wp1093179"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Include the name, address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address of the agency task and delivery order ombudsman (see <a href="#wp1095799">16.505</a>(b)(8)) if multiple awards may be made;
      </p>

(vii) Include authorization for placing oral orders, if appropriate, provided that the Government has established procedures for obligating funds and that oral orders are confirmed in writing.</p>
<a name="wp1093182"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Application</em>. Contracting officers may use an indefinite-quantity contract when the Government cannot predetermine, above a specified minimum, the precise quantities of supplies or services that the Government will require during the contract period, and it is inadvisable for the Government to commit itself for more than a minimum quantity. The contracting officer should use an indefinite-quantity contract only when a recurring need is anticipated.

(c) Multiple award preference—</p>
<a name="wp1093184"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Planning the acquisition.</p>
<a name="wp1093185"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Except for indefinite-quantity contracts for advisory and assistance services as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the contracting officer must, to the maximum extent practicable, give preference to making multiple awards of indefinite-quantity contracts under a single solicitation for the same or similar supplies or services to two or more sources.</p>
<a name="wp1093186"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii)(A) The contracting officer must determine whether multiple awards are appropriate as part of acquisition planning. The contracting officer must avoid situations in which awardees specialize exclusively in one or a few areas within the statement of work, thus creating the likelihood that orders in those areas will be awarded on a sole-source basis; however, each awardee need not be capable of performing every requirement as well as any other awardee under the contracts. The contracting officer should consider the following when determining the number of contracts to be awarded:</p>
<a name="wp1093187"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(1) The scope and complexity of the contract requirement.</p>
<a name="wp1093188"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(2) The expected duration and frequency of task or delivery orders.</p>
<a name="wp1093189"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(3) The mix of resources a contractor must have to perform expected task or delivery order requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1093190"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(4) The ability to maintain competition among the awardees throughout the contracts&rsquo; period of performance.</p>
<a name="wp1093191"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) The contracting officer must not use the multiple award approach if—</p>
<a name="wp1093192"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(1) Only one contractor is capable of providing performance at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized;</p>
<a name="wp1093193"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(2) Based on the contracting officer&rsquo;s knowledge of the market, more favorable terms and conditions, including pricing, will be provided if a single award is made;</p>
<a name="wp1093194"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(3) The expected cost of administration of multiple contracts outweighs the expected benefits of making multiple awards;</p>
<a name="wp1093195"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(4) The projected task orders are so integrally related that only a single contractor can reasonably perform the work;</p>
<a name="wp1093196"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(5) The total estimated value of the contract is less than the simplified acquisition threshold; or</p>
<a name="wp1093197"> </a><p class="pIndented4">
(6) Multiple awards would not be in the best interests of the Government.</p>
<a name="wp1093198"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(C) The contracting officer must document the decision whether or not to use multiple awards in the acquisition plan or contract file. The contracting officer may determine that a class of acquisitions is not appropriate for multiple awards (see <a href="Subpart%201_7.html#wp1084191">subpart 1.7</a>).
