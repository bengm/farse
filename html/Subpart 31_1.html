&ldquo;Accrued benefit cost method&rdquo; means an actuarial cost method under which units of benefits are assigned to each cost accounting period and are valued as they accrue; <em class="cEmphasis">i.e., </em>based on the services performed by each employee in the period involved. The measure of normal cost under this method for each cost accounting period is the present value of the units of benefit deemed to be credited to employees for service in that period. The measure of the actuarial accrued liability at a plan&rsquo;s inception date is the present value of the units of benefit credited to employees for service prior to that date. (This method is also known as the unit credit cost method without salary projection.).

31.100  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1089549"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart describes the applicability of the cost principles and procedures in succeeding subparts of this part to various types of contracts and subcontracts. It also describes the need for advance agreements.</p>
<a name="wp1089550"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
31.101  Objectives.</h3>
<a name="wp1089551"> </a><p class="pBody">
In recognition of differing organizational characteristics, the cost principles and procedures in the succeeding subparts are grouped basically by organizational type; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>commercial concerns and educational institutions. The overall objective is to provide that, to the extent practicable, all organizations of similar types doing similar work will follow the same cost principles and procedures. To achieve this uniformity, individual deviations concerning cost principles require advance approval of the agency head or designee. Class deviations for the civilian agencies require advance approval of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council. Class deviations for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration require advance approval of the Deputy Chief Acquisition Officer. Class deviations for the Department of Defense require advance approval of the Director of Defense Procurement, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.

The applicable subparts of <a href="FARTOCP31.html#wp253693">Part 31</a> shall be used in the pricing of fixed-price contracts, subcontracts, and modifications to contracts and subcontracts whenever (a) cost analysis is performed, or (b) a fixed-price contract clause requires the determination or negotiation of costs. However, application of cost principles to fixed-price contracts and subcontracts shall not be construed as a requirement to negotiate agreements on individual elements of cost in arriving at agreement on the total price. The final price accepted by the parties reflects agreement only on the total price. Further, notwithstanding the mandatory use of cost principles, the objective will continue to be to negotiate prices that are fair and reasonable, cost and other factors considered.

(i) Allowable ownership and operating costs shall be determined as follows:</p>
<a name="wp1089586"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) Actual cost data shall be used when such data can be determined for both ownership and operations costs for each piece of equipment, or groups of similar serial or series equipment, from the contractor&rsquo;s accounting records. When such costs cannot be so determined, the contracting agency may specify the use of a particular schedule of predetermined rates or any part thereof to determine ownership and operating costs of construction equipment (see subdivisions (d)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section). However, costs otherwise unallowable under this part shall not become allowable through the use of any schedule (see <a href="#wp1089616">31.109</a>(c)). For example, schedules need to be adjusted for Government contract costing purposes if they are based on replacement cost, include unallowable interest costs, or use improper cost of money rates or computations. Contracting officers should review the computations and factors included within the specified schedule and ensure that unallowable or unacceptably computed factors are not allowed in cost submissions.

<a name="wp1089587"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) Predetermined schedules of construction equipment use rates (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>the Construction Equipment Ownership and Operating Expense Schedule, published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, industry sponsored construction equipment cost guides, or commercially published schedules of construction equipment use cost) provide average ownership and operating rates for construction equipment. The allowance for operating costs may include costs for such items as fuel, filters, oil, and grease; servicing, repairs, and maintenance; and tire wear and repair. Costs of labor, mobilization, demobilization, overhead, and profit are generally not reflected in schedules, and separate consideration may be necessary.
      </p>
<a name="wp1089588"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(C) When a schedule of predetermined use rates for construction equipment is used to determine direct costs, all costs of equipment that are included in the cost allowances provided by the schedule shall be identified and eliminated from the contractor&rsquo;s other direct and indirect costs charged to the contract. If the contractor&rsquo;s accounting system provides for site or home office overhead allocations, all costs which are included in the equipment allowances may need to be included in any cost input base before computing the contractor&rsquo;s overhead rate. In periods of suspension of work pursuant to a contract clause, the allowance for equipment ownership shall not exceed an amount for standby cost as determined by the schedule or contract provision.</p>

<a name="wp1089617"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The extent of allowability of the costs covered in this part applies broadly to many accounting systems in varying contract situations. Thus, the reasonableness, the allocability and the allowability under the specific cost principles at <a href="Subpart%2031_2.html#wp1095552">Subparts 31.2</a>, <a href="Subpart%2031_3.html#wp1075583">31.3</a>, <a href="Subpart%2031_6.html#wp1088202">31.6</a>, and <a href="Subpart%2031_7.html#wp1079462">31.7</a> of certain costs may be difficult to determine. To avoid possible subsequent disallowance or dispute based on unreasonableness, unallocability or unallowability under the specific cost principles at <a href="Subpart%2031_2.html#wp1095552">Subparts 31.2</a>, <a href="Subpart%2031_3.html#wp1075583">31.3</a>, <a href="Subpart%2031_6.html#wp1088202">31.6</a>, and <a href="Subpart%2031_7.html#wp1079462">31.7</a>, contracting officers and contractors should seek advance agreement on the treatment of special or unusual costs and on statistical sampling methodologies at <a href="Subpart%2031_2.html#wp1095581">31.201-6</a>(c).
