In the event there are no agency unique requirements beyond the FAR, the requesting agency shall so inform the servicing agency contracting officer in writing.  For acquisitions on behalf of the Department of Defense, also see <a href="Subpart%2017_7.html#wp1076913">subpart 17.7</a>. for patent rights, see <a href="Subpart%2027_3.html#wp1042064">27.304-2</a>.

17.502-2  The Economy Act.</h3>
<a name="wp1078711"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The Economy Act (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">31 U.S.C. 1535</a>) authorizes agencies to enter into agreements to obtain supplies or services from another agency. The FAR applies when one agency uses another agency&rsquo;s contract to obtain supplies or services. If the interagency business transaction does not result in a contract or an order, then the FAR does not apply. The Economy Act also provides authority for placement of orders between major organizational units within an agency; procedures for such intra-agency transactions are addressed in agency regulations.

<a name="wp1078746"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The Economy Act applies when more specific statutory authority does not exist.
