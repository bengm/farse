(2) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the contracting officer must specify the due date in the contract.</p>

(3) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30th day after the date of the contractor's invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or contractor compliance with contract requirements.</p>

(3) Construction contracts contain special provisions concerning contractor payments to subcontractors, along with special contractor certification requirements.
