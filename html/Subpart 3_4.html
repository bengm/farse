<a name="wp1072721"> </a><p class="pBody">
Contractors&rsquo; arrangements to pay contingent fees for soliciting or obtaining Government contracts have long been considered contrary to public policy because such arrangements may lead to attempted or actual exercise of improper influence.

These statutes—
      </p>

<a name="wp1072724"> </a><p class="pBody">
