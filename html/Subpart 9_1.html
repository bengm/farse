(a) Purchases shall be made from, and contracts shall be awarded to, responsible prospective contractors only.</p>
<a name="wp1084073"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) No purchase or award shall be made unless the contracting officer makes an affirmative determination of responsibility. In the absence of information clearly indicating that the prospective contractor is responsible, the contracting officer shall make a determination of nonresponsibility.

(c) The award of a contract to a supplier based on lowest evaluated price alone can be false economy if there is subsequent default, late deliveries, or other unsatisfactory performance resulting in additional contractual or administrative costs. While it is important that Government purchases be made at the lowest price, this does not require an award to a supplier solely because that supplier submits the lowest offer. A prospective contractor must affirmatively demonstrate its responsibility, including, when necessary, the responsibility of its proposed subcontractors.</p>

(a) When it is necessary for a particular acquisition or class of acquisitions, the contracting officer shall develop, with the assistance of appropriate specialists, special standards of responsibility. Special standards may be particularly desirable when experience has demonstrated that unusual expertise or specialized facilities are needed for adequate contract performance. The special standards shall be set forth in the solicitation (and so identified) and shall apply to all offerors.</p>

9.104-3  Application of standards.</h3>
<a name="wp1084444"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Ability to obtain resources</em>. Except to the extent that a prospective contractor has sufficient resources or proposes to perform the contract by subcontracting, the contracting officer shall require acceptable evidence of the prospective contractor&rsquo;s ability to obtain required resources (see <a href="#wp1084076">9.104-1</a>(a), (e), and (f)). Acceptable evidence normally consists of a commitment or explicit arrangement, that will be in existence at the time of contract award, to rent, purchase, or otherwise acquire the needed facilities, equipment, other resources, or personnel. Consideration of a prime contractor&rsquo;s compliance with limitations on subcontracting shall take into account the time period covered by the contract base period or quantities plus option periods or quantities, if such options are considered when evaluating offers for award.
      </p>
<a name="wp1084090"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Satisfactory performance record</em>. A prospective contractor that is or recently has been seriously deficient in contract performance shall be presumed to be nonresponsible, unless the contracting officer determines that the circumstances were properly beyond the contractor&rsquo;s control, or that the contractor has taken appropriate corrective action. Past failure to apply sufficient tenacity and perseverance to perform acceptably is strong evidence of nonresponsibility. Failure to meet the quality requirements of the contract is a significant factor to consider in determining satisfactory performance. The contracting officer shall consider the number of contracts involved and the extent of deficient performance in each contract when making this determination. If the pending contract requires a subcontracting plan pursuant to <a href="Subpart%2019_7.html#wp1088741">subpart 19.7</a>, The Small Business Subcontracting Program, the contracting officer shall also consider the prospective contractor&rsquo;s compliance with subcontracting plans under recent contracts.

(c) <em class="cEmphasis">Affiliated concerns</em>. Affiliated concerns (see &ldquo;Concern&rdquo; in <a href="Subpart%2019_1.html#wp1101795">19.001</a> and &ldquo;Affiliates&rdquo; in <a href="Subpart%2019_1.html#wp1101806">19.101</a>) are normally considered separate entities in determining whether the concern that is to perform the contract meets the applicable standards for responsibility. However, the contracting officer shall consider the affiliate&rsquo;s past performance and integrity when they may adversely affect the prospective contractor&rsquo;s responsibility.
      </p>
<a name="wp1084092"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d)(1) <em class="cEmphasis">Small business concerns</em>. Upon making a determination of nonresponsibility with regard to a small business concern, the contracting officer shall refer the matter to the Small Business Administration, which will decide whether to issue a Certificate of Competency (see subpart <a href="Subpart%2019_6.html#wp1089863">19.6</a>).

9.104-4  Subcontractor responsibility.</h3>

Determinations of prospective subcontractor responsibility may affect the Government&rsquo;s determination of the prospective prime contractor&rsquo;s responsibility.

(b) When it is in the Government&rsquo;s interest to do so, the contracting officer may directly determine a prospective subcontractor&rsquo;s responsibility (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>when the prospective contract involves medical supplies, urgent requirements, or substantial subcontracting). In this case, the same standards used to determine a prime contractor&rsquo;s responsibility shall be used by the Government to determine subcontractor responsibility.

(b)(1) When making a responsibility determination, the contracting officer shall consider all the information available through FAPIIS with regard to the offeror and any immediate owner, predecessor, or subsidiary identified for that offeror in FAPIIS, as well as other past performance information on the offeror (see <a href="Subpart%2042_15.html#wp1075411">subpart 42.15</a>).
