(b) Advance payments may be provided on any type of contract; however, the agency shall authorize advance payments sparingly. Except for the contracts described in <a href="#wp1030701">32.403</a>(a) and (b), advance payment is the least preferred method of contract financing (see <a href="Subpart%2032_1.html#wp1024994">32.106</a>) and generally they should not be authorized if other types of financing are reasonably available to the contractor in adequate amounts. Loans and credit at excessive interest rates or other exorbitant charges, or loans from other Government agencies, are not considered reasonably available financing.
