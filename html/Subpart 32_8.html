<a name="wp1029221"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
32.803  Policies.</h3>
<a name="wp1029222"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Any assignment of claims that has been made under the Act to any type of financing institution listed in <a href="#wp1029208">32.802</a>(b) may thereafter be further assigned and reassigned to any such institution if the conditions in <a href="#wp1029208">32.802</a>(d) and (e) continue to be met.
      </p>
<a name="wp1029223"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) A contract may prohibit the assignment of claims if the agency determines the prohibition to be in the Government&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<a name="wp1029224"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Under a requirements or indefinite quantity type contract that authorizes ordering and payment by multiple Government activities, amounts due for individual orders for $1,000 or more may be assigned.</p>
<a name="wp1029225"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Any contract of a designated agency (see FAR <a href="#wp1029205">32.801</a>), except a contract under which full payment has been made, may include a no-setoff commitment only when a determination of need is made by the head of the agency, in accordance with the Presidential delegation of authority dated October 3, 1995, and after such determination has been published in the <em class="cEmphasis">Federal Register. </em>The Presidential delegation makes such determinations of need subject to further guidance issued by the Office of Federal Procurement Policy. The following guidance has been provided:
      </p>
<a name="wp1029226"> </a><p class="pBodyAltNoIndent">
Use of the no-setoff provision may be appropriate to facilitate the national defense; in the event of a national emergency or natural disaster; or when the use of the no-setoff provision may facilitate private financing of contract performance. However, in the event an offeror is significantly indebted to the United States, the contracting officer should consider whether the inclusion of the no-setoff commitment in a particular contract is in the best interests of the United States. In such an event, the contracting officer should consult with the Government officer(s) responsible for collecting the debt(s).</p>
<a name="wp1029227"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) When an assigned contract does not include a no-setoff commitment, the Government may apply against payments to the assignee any liability of the contractor to the Government arising independently of the assigned contract if the liability existed at the time notice of the assignment was received even though that liability had not yet matured so as to be due and payable.</p>
<a name="wp1029228"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
32.804  Extent of assignee&rsquo;s protection.</h3>
<a name="wp1029229"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) No payments made by the Government to the assignee under any contract assigned in accordance with the Act may be recovered on account of any liability of the contractor to the Government. This immunity of the assignee is effective whether the contractor&rsquo;s liability arises from or independently of the assigned contract.</p>
<a name="wp1029230"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the inclusion of a no-setoff commitment in an assigned contract entitles the assignee to receive contract payments free of reduction or setoff for—</p>
<a name="wp1029231"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Any liability of the contractor to the Government arising independently of the contract; and</p>
<a name="wp1029232"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Any of the following liabilities of the contractor to the Government arising from the assigned contract:</p>
<a name="wp1029233"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Renegotiation under any statute or contract clause.</p>
<a name="wp1029234"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Fines.</p>
<a name="wp1029235"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Penalties, exclusive of amounts that may be collected or withheld from the contractor under, or for failure to comply with, the terms of the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1029236"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) Taxes or social security contributions.</p>
<a name="wp1029237"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Withholding or nonwithholding of taxes or social security contributions.</p>
<a name="wp1029238"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) In some circumstances, a setoff may be appropriate even though the assigned contract includes a no-setoff commitment; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g.—</em></p>
<a name="wp1029239"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) When the assignee has neither made a loan under the assignment nor made a commitment to do so; or</p>
<a name="wp1029240"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) To the extent that the amount due on the contract exceeds the amount of any loans made or expected to be made under a firm commitment for financing.</p>
