(b) The purpose of the IBR is to verify the technical content and the realism of the related performance budgets, resources, and schedules. It should provide a mutual understanding of the inherent risks in offerors&rsquo;/ contractors&rsquo; performance plans and the underlying management control systems, and it should formulate a plan to handle these risks.</p>
<a name="wp1112577"> </a><p class="pBody">

If a pre-award IBR will be conducted, the solicitation must include the procedures for conducting the IBR and address whether offerors will be reimbursed for the associated costs.
