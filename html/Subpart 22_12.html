Subpart 22.12—Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts</h2>
<a name="wp1085845"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1200  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1085856"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for implementing Executive Order 13495 of January 30, 2009, Nondisplacement of Qualified Workers Under Service Contracts, and related Secretary of Labor regulations and instructions (see 29 CFR part 9).</p>
<a name="wp1085864"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1201  Definitions.</h3>
<a name="wp1085868"> </a><p class="pBody">
As used in this subpart—</p>
<a name="wp1085876"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;United States&rdquo; means the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Johnston Island, Wake Island, and outer Continental Shelf as defined in the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331, et seq.), but does not include any other place subject to United States jurisdiction or any United States base or possession in a foreign country (see 29 CFR 4.112).</p>
<a name="wp1085884"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1202  Policy.</h3>
<a name="wp1085897"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When a service contract succeeds a contract for performance of the same or similar services, as defined at 29 CFR 9.2, at the same location, the successor contractor and its subcontractors are required to offer those service employees that are employed under the predecessor contract, and whose employment will be terminated as a result of the award of the successor contract, a right of first refusal of employment under the contract in positions for which they are qualified.  Executive Order 13495 generally prohibits employment openings under the successor contract until such right of first refusal has been provided, when consistent with applicable law.  </p>
<a name="wp1085898"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Nothing in Executive Order 13495 shall be construed to permit a contractor or subcontractor to fail to comply with any provision of any other Executive order or law.  For example, the requirements of the HUBZone Program (see subpart <a href="Subpart%2019_13.html#wp1094801">19.13</a>), Executive Order 11246 (Equal Employment Opportunity), and the Vietnam Era Veterans&rsquo; Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974 may, in certain circumstances, conflict with the requirements of Executive Order 13495.  All applicable laws and Executive orders must be satisfied in tandem with, and if necessary prior to, the requirements of Executive Order 13495 and this subpart.

22.1203-3  Waiver.</h3>
<a name="wp1085985"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The senior procurement executive of the procuring agency may waive some or all of the provisions of this subpart after determining in writing that the application of this subpart would not serve the purposes of Executive Order 13495 or would impair the ability of the Federal Government to procure services on an economical and efficient basis.  Such waivers may be made for a contract, subcontract, or purchase order, or with respect to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders. See 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a waiver could or would not be appropriate.  The waiver must be reflected in a written analysis as described in 29 CFR 9.4(d)(4)(i) and must be completed by the contract solicitation date, or the waiver is inoperative. The senior procurement executive shall not redelegate this waiver authority. </p>
<a name="wp1085994"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b)(1) When an agency exercises its waiver authority with respect to any contract, subcontract, or purchase order, the contracting officer shall direct the contractor to notify affected workers and their collective bargaining representative in writing, no later than five business days after the solicitation issuance date, of the agency&rsquo;s determination. The notice shall include facts supporting the determination. The contracting officer&rsquo;s failure to direct that the contractor provide the notice as provided in this subparagraph shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1147587">52.222-17</a> in the solicitation. 
      </p>
<a name="wp1086007"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Where a contracting agency waives application to a class of contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders, the contracting officer shall, with respect to each individual solicitation, direct the contractor to notify incumbent workers and their collective bargaining representatives in writing, no later than five business days after each solicitation issuance date, of the agency&rsquo;s determination. The notice shall include facts supporting the determination.  The contracting officer&rsquo;s failure to direct that the contractor provide the notice provided in this subparagraph shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1147587">52.222-17</a> in the solicitation.
      </p>
<a name="wp1086361"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) In addition, the agency shall notify the Department of Labor of its waiver decision and provide the Department of Labor with a copy of its written analysis no later than five business days after the solicitation issuance date (see 29 CFR 9.4(d)(2)).  Failure to comply with this notification requirement shall render the waiver decision inoperative, and the contracting officer shall include the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1147587">52.222-17</a> in the solicitation.  The waiver decision and related written analysis shall be sent to the following address:  U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Branch of Government Contracts Enforcement, 200 Constitution Avenue, Room S-3006, Washington, D.C. 20210, or email to: <a href="mailto:Displaced@dol.gov" target="_blank"><span class="cWebJump">Displaced@dol.gov</span></a>.

22.1203-4  Method of job offer.</h3>
<a name="wp1086079"> </a><p class="pBody">
A job offer made by a successor contractor must be a bona fide express offer of employment on the contract.  Each bona fide express offer made to a qualified service employee on the predecessor contract must have a stated time limit of not less than 10 days for an employee response.  Prior to the expiration of the 10-day period, the contractor is prohibited from offering employment on the contract to any other person, subject to the exceptions at <a href="#wp1086087">22.1203-5</a>.  Any question concerning an employee&rsquo;s qualifications shall be decided based upon the individual&rsquo;s education and employment history, with particular emphasis on the employee&rsquo;s experience on the predecessor contract, and a contractor may utilize employment screening processes only when such processes are provided for by the contracting agency, are conditions of the service contract, and are consistent with the Executive Order.  An offer of employment will be presumed to be bona fide even if it is not for a position similar to the one the employee previously held, but is one for which the employee is qualified, and even if it is subject to different employment terms and conditions, including changes to pay or benefits.  (See 29 CFR 9.12(b) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which a bona fide offer of employment can occur.)

<a name="wp1086087"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1203-5  Exceptions.</h3>
<a name="wp1086095"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A successor contractor or its subcontractors are not required to offer employment to any service employee of the predecessor contractor who—</p>
<a name="wp1086108"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Will be retained by the predecessor contractor.  </p>
<a name="wp1086103"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The successor contractor or any of its subcontractors reasonably believes, based on the particular service employee&rsquo;s past performance, has failed to perform suitably on the job.  (See 29 CFR 9.12(c)(4) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which this exception would or would not be appropriate.) </p>
<a name="wp1086119"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) A successor contractor or its subcontractors may employ under the contract any of its current service employees who (1) have worked for the successor contractor or its subcontractors for at least three months immediately preceding the commencement of the successor contract, and (2) would otherwise face lay-off or discharge.</p>
<a name="wp1086127"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The successor contractor bears the responsibility of demonstrating the appropriateness of claiming any of the preceding exceptions and the exemption listed at <a href="#wp1085931">22.1203-2</a>(a)(5) involving nonfederal work.
      </p>
<a name="wp1086132"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1203-6  Reduced staffing.</h3>
<a name="wp1086140"> </a><p class="pBody">
A successor contractor and its subcontractors may employ fewer service employees than the predecessor contractor employed in connection with performance of the work.  Thus, the successor contractor need not offer employment on the contract to all service employees on the predecessor contract, but must offer employment only to the number of eligible service employees the successor contractor believes necessary to meet its anticipated staffing pattern.  Where a successor contractor does not initially offer employment to all the predecessor contract service employees, the obligation to offer employment shall continue for 90 days after the successor contractor&rsquo;s first date of performance on the contract.  (See 29 CFR 9.12(d) for regulatory provisions addressing circumstances in which reduced staffing can occur.)</p>
<a name="wp1086148"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1204  Certified service employee lists. </h3>
<a name="wp1086409"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Not less than 30 days before completion of the contract, the predecessor contractor is required to furnish to the contracting officer a certified list of the names of all service employees working under the contract and its subcontracts at the time the list is submitted.  The certified list must also contain anniversary dates of employment of each service employee under the contract and subcontracts for services.  The information on this list is the same as that on the seniority list required by paragraph (n) of the clause at <a href="52_222.html#wp1160021">52.222-41</a>, Service Contract Labor Standards.  If there are no changes to the workforce before the predecessor contract is completed, then the predecessor contractor is not required to submit a revised list 10 days prior to completion of performance and the requirements of <a href="52_222.html#wp1160021">52.222-41</a>(n) are met.  When there are changes to the workforce after submission of the 30-day list, the predecessor contractor shall submit a revised certified list not less than 10 days prior to performance completion.
      </p>
<a name="wp1086168"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Immediately upon receipt of the certified service employee list but not before contract award, the contracting officer shall provide the certified service employee list to the successor contractor, and, if requested, to employees of the predecessor contractor or subcontractors or their authorized representatives.</p>
<a name="wp1086156"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1205  Notification to contractors and service employees. </h3>
<a name="wp1086176"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The contracting officer shall direct that the predecessor contractor provides written notice to service employees of their possible right to an offer of employment with the successor contractor.  The written notice shall be—</p>
<a name="wp1086189"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite; or</p>
<a name="wp1086190"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Delivered to the service employees individually.  If such delivery is via e-mail, the notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. </p>
<a name="wp1086184"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracting officers may advise contractors to provide the notice in Appendix B to 29 CFR chapter 9.  Where a significant portion of the predecessor contractor&rsquo;s workforce is not fluent in English, the contractor shall provide the notice in English and the language(s) with which service employees are more familiar.  English and Spanish versions of the notice are available on the Department of Labor website at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts.">http://www.dol.gov/whd/govcontracts</a>.

<a name="wp1086203"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.1206  Remedies and sanctions for violations of this subpart. </h3>
<a name="wp1086216"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The Secretary of Labor has the authority to issue orders prescribing appropriate remedies, including, but not limited to, requiring the successor contractor to offer employment, in positions for which the employees are qualified, to service employees from the predecessor contract and payment of wages lost. (See 29 CFR 9.24(a)).</p>
<a name="wp1086217"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) After an investigation (see 29 CFR 9.23) and a determination by the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, that lost wages or other monetary relief is due, the Administrator may direct that so much of the accrued payments due on either the contract or any other contract between the contractor and the Government shall be withheld as are necessary to pay the monies due.  Upon the final order of the Secretary of Labor that such monies are due, the Administrator may direct that such withheld funds be transferred to the Department of Labor for disbursement.  (See 29 CFR 9.24(c)). </p>
<a name="wp1086218"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) If the contracting officer or the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, Department of Labor, finds that the predecessor contractor has failed to provide the list required by <a href="#wp1086148">22.1204</a>, the contracting officer may, in his or her discretion, or on request by the Administrator, suspend contract payment until such time as the contractor provides the list to the contracting officer.
      </p>
<a name="wp1086231"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The Secretary of Labor may also suspend or debar a contractor or subcontractor for a period of up to three years for violations of 29 CFR part 9. </p>
