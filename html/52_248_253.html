(a) <em class="cEmphasis">General</em>. The Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and submit value engineering change proposals (VECP&rsquo;s) voluntarily.

&ldquo;Acquisition savings,&rdquo; as used in this clause, means savings resulting from the application of a VECP to contracts awarded by the same contracting office or its successor for essentially the same unit. Acquisition savings include—</p>
<a name="wp1119388"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Instant contract savings, which are the net cost reductions on this, the instant contract, and which are equal to the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract units affected by the VECP, less the Contractor&rsquo;s allowable development and implementation costs;</p>
<a name="wp1119389"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Concurrent contract savings, which are net reductions in the prices of other contracts that are definitized and ongoing at the time the VECP is accepted; and</p>
<a name="wp1119390"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Future contract savings, which are the product of the future unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of future contract units in the sharing base. On an instant contract, future contract savings include savings on increases in quantities after VECP acceptance that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, additional orders, and funding of subsequent year requirements on a multiyear contract.</p>
<a name="wp1119391"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Collateral savings,&rdquo; as used in this clause, means those measurable net reductions resulting from a VECP in the agency&rsquo;s overall projected collateral costs, exclusive of acquisition savings, whether or not the acquisition cost changes.</p>
<a name="wp1119392"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Contracting office&rdquo; includes any contracting office that the acquisition is transferred to, such as another branch of the agency or another agency&rsquo;s office that is performing a joint acquisition action.</p>

&ldquo;Contractor&rsquo;s development and implementation costs,&rdquo; as used in this clause, means those costs the Contractor incurs on a VECP specifically in developing, testing, preparing, and submitting the VECP, as well as those costs the Contractor incurs to make the contractual changes required by Government acceptance of a VECP.</p>
<a name="wp1119394"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Future unit cost reduction,&rdquo; as used in this clause, means the instant unit cost reduction adjusted as the Contracting Officer considers necessary for projected learning or changes in quantity during the sharing period. It is calculated at the time the VECP is accepted and applies either—</p>
<a name="wp1119395"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Throughout the sharing period, unless the Contracting Officer decides that recalculation is necessary because conditions are significantly different from those previously anticipated; or</p>

&ldquo;Government costs,&rdquo; as used in this clause, means those agency costs that result directly from developing and implementing the VECP, such as any net increases in the cost of testing, operations, maintenance, and logistics support. The term does not include the normal administrative costs of processing the VECP or any increase in this contract&rsquo;s cost or price resulting from negative instant contract savings.</p>
<a name="wp1119398"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Instant contract,&rdquo; as used in this clause, means this contract, under which the VECP is submitted. It does not include increases in quantities after acceptance of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, or additional orders. If this is a multiyear contract, the term does not include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. If this contract is a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm prices have been established.</p>
<a name="wp1119399"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Instant unit cost reduction&rdquo; means the amount of the decrease in unit cost of performance (without deducting any Contractor&rsquo;s development or implementation costs) resulting from using the VECP on this, the instant contract. If this is a service contract, the instant unit cost reduction is normally equal to the number of hours per line-item task saved by using the VECP on this contract, multiplied by the appropriate contract labor rate.</p>
<a name="wp1119400"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Negative instant contract savings&rdquo; means the increase in the cost or price of this contract when the acceptance of a VECP results in an excess of the Contractor&rsquo;s allowable development and implementation costs over the product of the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract units affected.</p>
<a name="wp1119401"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Net acquisition savings&rdquo; means total acquisition savings, including instant, concurrent, and future contract savings, less Government costs.</p>

(b) The Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (SAFETY Act), <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">6 U.S.C. 441-444</a>, creates certain liability limitations for claims arising out of, relating to, or resulting from an act of terrorism where QATTs have been deployed.

SAFETY Act designation and SAFETY Act certification are designed to support effective technologies aimed at preventing, detecting, identifying, or deterring acts of terrorism, or limiting the harm that such acts might otherwise cause, and which also meet other prescribed criteria.  For some classes of technologies, DHS may issue a block designation/certification in order to lessen the burdens for filing for SAFETY Act designation or SAFETY Act certifications by not requiring applicants to provide certain information otherwise required and in order to offer expedited review of any application submitted pursuant to a block designation/certification.
