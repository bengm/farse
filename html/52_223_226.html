Although computers must be capable of using input devices and computer displays, as noted in (2) and (3) above, computer systems do not need to include these devices on shipment to meet this definition.  This definition does not include server computers, gaming consoles, mobile telephones, portable hand-held calculators, portable digital assistants (PDAs), MP3 players, or any other mobile computing device with displays less than 4 inches, measured diagonally.</p>

&ldquo;Desktop computer&rdquo; means a computer where the main unit is intended to be located in a permanent location, often on a desk or on the floor.
