<a name="wp1082929"> </a><p class="pBody">
As used in this subpart—</p>
<a name="wp1082930"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Cancellation&rdquo; means the cancellation (within a contractually specified time) of the total requirements of all remaining program years. Cancellation results when the contracting officer—</p>
<a name="wp1082931"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Notifies the contractor of nonavailability of funds for contract performance for any subsequent program year; or</p>
<a name="wp1082932"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Fails to notify the contractor that funds are available for performance of the succeeding program year requirement.</p>
<a name="wp1082933"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Cancellation ceiling&rdquo; means the maximum cancellation charge that the contractor can receive in the event of cancellation.</p>
<a name="wp1082934"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Cancellation charge&rdquo; means the amount of unrecovered costs which would have been recouped through amortization over the full term of the contract, including the term canceled.</p>
<a name="wp1082935"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Multi-year contract&rdquo; means a contract for the purchase of supplies or services for more than 1, but not more than 5, program years. A multi-year contract may provide that performance under the contract during the second and subsequent years of the contract is contingent upon the appropriation of funds, and (if it does so provide) may provide for a cancellation payment to be made to the contractor if appropriations are not made. The key distinguishing difference between multi-year contracts and multiple year contracts is that multi-year contracts, defined in the statutes cited at <a href="#wp1082924">17.101</a>, buy more than 1 year&rsquo;s requirement (of a product or service) without establishing and having to exercise an option for each program year after the first.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082936"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Nonrecurring costs&rdquo; means those costs which are generally incurred on a one-time basis and include such costs as plant or equipment relocation, plant rearrangement, special tooling and special test equipment, preproduction engineering, initial spoilage and rework, and specialized work force training.</p>
<a name="wp1082937"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Recurring costs&rdquo; means costs that vary with the quantity being produced, such as labor and materials.</p>
<a name="wp1082938"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
17.104  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1082939"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Multi-year contracting is a special contracting method to acquire known requirements in quantities and total cost not over planned requirements for up to 5 years unless otherwise authorized by statute, even though the total funds ultimately to be obligated may not be available at the time of contract award. This method may be used in sealed bidding or contracting by negotiation.</p>
<a name="wp1082940"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Multi-year contracting is a flexible contracting method applicable to a wide range of acquisitions. The extent to which cancellation terms are used in multi-year contracts will depend on the unique circumstances of each contract. Accordingly, for multi-year contracts, the agency head may authorize modification of the requirements of this subpart and the clause at <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1135832">52.217-2</a>, Cancellation Under Multi-year Contracts.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082941"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Agency funding of multi-year contracts shall conform to the policies in OMB Circulars A-11 (Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates) and A-34 (Instructions on Budget Execution) and other applicable guidance regarding the funding of multi-year contracts. As provided by that guidance, the funds obligated for multi-year contracts must be sufficient to cover any potential cancellation and/or termination costs; and multi-year contracts for the acquisition of fixed assets should be fully funded or funded in stages that are economically or programmatically viable.</p>
<a name="wp1082942"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The termination for convenience procedure may apply to any Government contract, including multiyear contracts. As contrasted with cancellation, termination can be effected at any time during the life of the contract (cancellation is effected between fiscal years) and can be for the total quantity or partial quantity (where as cancellation must be for all subsequent fiscal years&rsquo; quantities).</p>

17.106  Procedures.</h3>
<a name="wp1082967"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
17.106-1  General.</h3>
<a name="wp1082968"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">Method of contracting</em>. The nature of the requirement should govern the selection of the method of contracting, since the multi-year procedure is compatible with sealed bidding, including two-step sealed bidding, and negotiation.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082969"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Type of contract.</em> Given the longer performance period associated with multi-year acquisition, consideration in pricing fixed-priced contracts should be given to the use of economic price adjustment terms and profit objectives commensurate with contractor risk and financing arrangements.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082970"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Cancellation procedures.</p>
<a name="wp1082971"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) All program years except the first are subject to cancellation. For each program year subject to cancellation, the contracting officer shall establish a cancellation ceiling. Ceilings must exclude amounts for requirements included in prior program years. The contracting officer shall reduce the cancellation ceiling for each program year in direct proportion to the remaining requirements subject to cancellation. For example, consider that the total nonrecurring costs (see <a href="Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1208736">15.408</a>, <a href="Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1227381">Table 15-2</a>, Formats for Submission of Line Items Summaries C(8)) are estimated at 10 percent of the total multi-year price, and the percentages for each of the program year requirements for 5 years are (i) 30 in the first year, (ii) 30 in the second, (iii) 20 in the third, (iv) 10 in the fourth, and (v) 10 in the fifth. The cancellation percentages, after deducting 3 percent for the first program year, would be 7, 4, 2, and 1 percent of the total price applicable to the second, third, fourth, and fifth program years, respectively.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082972"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) In determining cancellation ceilings, the contracting officer must estimate reasonable preproduction or startup, labor learning, and other nonrecurring costs to be incurred by an &ldquo;average&rdquo; prime contractor or subcontractor, which would be applicable to, and which normally would be amortized over, the items or services to be furnished under the multi-year requirements. Nonrecurring costs include such costs, where applicable, as plant or equipment relocation or rearrangement, special tooling and special test equipment, preproduction engineering, initial rework, initial spoilage, pilot runs, allocable portions of the costs of facilities to be acquired or established for the conduct of the work, costs incurred for the assembly, training, and transportation to and from the job site of a specialized work force, and unrealized labor learning. They shall not include any costs of labor or materials, or other expenses (except as indicated above), which might be incurred for performance of subsequent program year requirements. The total estimate of the above costs must then be compared with the best estimate of the contract cost to arrive at a reasonable percentage or dollar figure. To perform this calculation, the contracting officer should obtain in-house engineering cost estimates identifying the detailed recurring and nonrecurring costs, and the effect of labor learning.</p>
<a name="wp1082973"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer shall establish cancellation dates for each program year&rsquo;s requirements regarding production lead time and the date by which funding for these requirements can reasonably be established. The contracting officer shall include these dates in the schedule, as appropriate.</p>
<a name="wp1082974"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) <em class="cEmphasis">Cancellation ceilings</em>. Cancellation ceilings and dates may be revised after issuing the solicitation if necessary. In sealed bidding, the contracting officer shall change the ceiling by amending the solicitation before bid opening. In two-step sealed bidding, discussions conducted during the first step may indicate the need for revised ceilings and dates which may be incorporated in step two. In a negotiated acquisition, negotiations with offerors may provide information requiring a change in cancellation ceilings and dates before final negotiation and contract award.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082975"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) <em class="cEmphasis">Payment of cancellation charges</em>. If cancellation occurs, the Government&rsquo;s liability will be determined by the terms of the applicable contract.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082976"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) <em class="cEmphasis">Presolicitation or pre-bid conferences</em>. To ensure that all interested sources of supply are thoroughly aware of how multi-year contracting is accomplished, use of presolicitation or pre-bid conferences may be advisable.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082977"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) <em class="cEmphasis">Payment limit.</em> The contracting officer shall limit the Government&rsquo;s payment obligation to an amount available for contract performance. The contracting officer shall insert the amount for the first program year in the contract upon award and modify it for successive program years upon availability of funds.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082978"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) <em class="cEmphasis">Termination payment</em>. If the contract is terminated for the convenience of the Government in whole, including requirements subject to cancellation, the Government&rsquo;s obligation shall not exceed the amount specified in the Schedule as available for contract performance, plus the cancellation ceiling.

Obtaining both also provides a basis for the computation of savings and other benefits. However, the preparation and evaluation of dual offers may increase administrative costs and workload for both offerors and the Government, especially for large or complex acquisitions. The head of a contracting activity may authorize the use of a solicitation requesting only multi-year prices, provided it is found that such a solicitation is in the Government&rsquo;s interest, and that dual proposals are not necessary to meet the objectives in <a href="#wp1082956">17.105-2</a>.
