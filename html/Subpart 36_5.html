36.500  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1076707"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart prescribes clauses for insertion in solicitations and contracts for (a) construction and (b) dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements contracts. Provisions and clauses prescribed elsewhere in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) shall also be used in such solicitations and contracts when the conditions specified in the prescriptions for the provisions and clauses are applicable.</p>

36.501  Performance of work by the contractor.</h3>
<a name="wp1076709"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) To assure adequate interest in and supervision of all work involved in larger projects, the contractor shall be required to perform a significant part of the contract work with its own forces. The contract shall express this requirement in terms of a percentage that reflects the minimum amount of work the contractor must perform with its own forces. This percentage is (1) as high as the contracting officer considers appropriate for the project, consistent with customary or necessary specialty subcontracting and the complexity and magnitude of the work, and (2) ordinarily not less than 12 percent unless a greater percentage is required by law or agency regulation. Specialties such as plumbing, heating, and electrical work are usually subcontracted, and should not normally be considered in establishing the amount of work required to be performed by the contractor.</p>
