This part prescribes policy and procedures that are specific to the acquisition and management of services by contract. This part applies to all contracts and orders for services regardless of the contract type or kind of service being acquired. This part requires the use of performance-based acquisitions for services to the maximum extent practicable and prescribes policies and procedures for use of performance-based acquisition methods (see <a href="Subpart%2037_6.html#wp1074195">subpart 37.6</a>).

&ldquo;Adjusted hourly rate (including uncompensated overtime)&rdquo; is the rate that results from multiplying the hourly rate for a 40-hour work week by 40, and then dividing by the proposed hours per week which includes uncompensated overtime hours over and above the standard 40-hour work week. For example, 45 hours proposed on a 40-hour work week basis at $20 per hour would be converted to an uncompensated overtime rate of $17.78 per hour ($20.00 x 40 / 45 = $17.78).</p>

&ldquo;Service contract&rdquo; means a contract that directly engages the time and effort of a contractor whose primary purpose is to perform an identifiable task rather than to furnish an end item of supply.

37.104  Personal services contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1082925"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) A personal services contract is characterized by the employer-employee relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor&rsquo;s personnel. The Government is normally required to obtain its employees by direct hire under competitive appointment or other procedures required by the civil service laws. Obtaining personal services by contract, rather than by direct hire, circumvents those laws unless Congress has specifically authorized acquisition of the services by contract.</p>
<a name="wp1082926"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Agencies shall not award personal services contracts unless specifically authorized by statute (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em><a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t05t08+2+3++%285%29%20%20AND">5 U.S.C.3109</a>) to do so.
      </p>
<a name="wp1082927"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c)(1) An employer-employee relationship under a service contract occurs when, as a result of (i) the contract&rsquo;s terms or (ii) the manner of its administration during performance, contractor personnel are subject to the relatively continuous supervision and control of a Government officer or employee. However, giving an order for a specific article or service, with the right to reject the finished product or result, is not the type of supervision or control that converts an individual who is an independent contractor (such as a contractor employee) into a Government employee.</p>
<a name="wp1082928"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Each contract arrangement must be judged in the light of its own facts and circumstances, the key question always being: Will the Government exercise relatively continuous supervision and control over the contractor personnel performing the contract. The sporadic, unauthorized supervision of only one of a large number of contractor employees might reasonably be considered not relevant, while relatively continuous Government supervision of a substantial number of contractor employees would have to be taken strongly into account (see (d) of this section).</p>
<a name="wp1082929"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The following descriptive elements should be used as a guide in assessing whether or not a proposed contract is personal in nature:</p>
<a name="wp1082930"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Performance on site.</p>
<a name="wp1082931"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Principal tools and equipment furnished by the Government.</p>
<a name="wp1082932"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Services are applied directly to the integral effort of agencies or an organizational subpart in furtherance of assigned function or mission.</p>
<a name="wp1082933"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Comparable services, meeting comparable needs, are performed in the same or similar agencies using civil service personnel.</p>
<a name="wp1082934"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) The need for the type of service provided can reasonably be expected to last beyond 1 year.</p>
<a name="wp1082935"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(6) The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which it is provided, reasonably requires directly or indirectly, Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to—</p>
<a name="wp1082936"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Adequately protect the Government&rsquo;s interest;</p>
<a name="wp1082937"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Retain control of the function involved; or</p>
<a name="wp1082938"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or employee.</p>
<a name="wp1082939"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) When specific statutory authority for a personal service contract is cited, obtain the review and opinion of legal counsel.</p>
<a name="wp1082940"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Personal services contracts for the services of individual experts or consultants are limited by the Classification Act. In addition, the Office of Personnel Management has established requirements which apply in acquiring the personal services of experts or consultants in this manner (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>benefits, taxes, conflicts of interest). Therefore, the contracting officer shall effect necessary coordination with the cognizant civilian personnel office.

37.105  Competition in service contracting.</h3>
<a name="wp1082942"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Unless otherwise provided by statute, contracts for services shall be awarded through sealed bidding whenever the conditions in <a href="Subpart%206_4.html#wp1087241">6.401</a>(a) are met, (except see <a href="Subpart%206_4.html#wp1087241">6.401</a>(b)).

<a name="wp1082943"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The provisions of statute and <a href="FARTOCP06.html#wp280339">Part 6</a> of this regulation requiring competition apply fully to service contracts. The method of contracting used to provide for competition may vary with the type of service being acquired and may not necessarily be limited to price competition.

37.106  Funding and term of service contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1082945"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When contracts for services are funded by annual appropriations, the term of contracts so funded shall not extend beyond the end of the fiscal year of the appropriation except when authorized by law (see paragraph (b) of this section for certain service contracts, <a href="Subpart%2032_7.html#wp1028604">32.703-2</a> for contracts conditioned upon availability of funds, and <a href="Subpart%2032_7.html#wp1028612">32.703-3</a> for contracts crossing fiscal years).

(b) The head of an executive agency, except NASA, may enter into a contract, exercise an option, or place an order under a contract for severable services for a period that begins in one fiscal year and ends in the next fiscal year if the period of the contract awarded, option exercised, or order placed does not exceed one year (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">10 U.S.C. 2410a</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 3902</a>).

37.107  Service Contract Labor Standards.</h3>
<a name="wp1084901"> </a><p class="pBody">
<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. chapter 65</a>, Service Contract Labor Standards, provides for minimum wages and fringe benefits as well as other conditions of work under certain types of service contracts. Whether or not the Service Contract Labor Standards statute applies to a specific service contract will be determined by the definitions and exceptions given in the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, or implementing regulations.

This prohibition applies only to contracts with organizations that offer quasi-military armed forces for hire, or with their employees, regardless of the contract&rsquo;s character.

Examples of circumstances causing such delays are bid protests and alleged mistakes in bid. In order to avoid negotiation of short extensions to existing contracts, the contracting officer may include an option clause (see <a href="Subpart%2017_2.html#wp1078175">17.208</a>(f)) in solicitations and contracts which will enable the Government to require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. However, these rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance thereunder shall not exceed 6 months.
