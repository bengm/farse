44.201-1  Consent requirements.</h3>
<a name="wp1075010"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) If the contractor has an approved purchasing system, consent is required for subcontracts specifically identified by the contracting officer in the subcontracts clause of the contract. The contracting officer may require consent to subcontract if the contracting officer has determined that an individual consent action is required to protect the Government adequately because of the subcontract type, complexity, or value, or because the subcontract needs special surveillance. These can be subcontracts for critical systems, subsystems, components, or services. Subcontracts may be identified by subcontract number or by class of items (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>subcontracts for engines on a prime contract for airframes).

(b) If the contractor does not have an approved purchasing system, consent to subcontract is required for cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, labor-hour, or letter contracts, and also for unpriced actions (including unpriced modifications and unpriced delivery orders) under fixed-price contracts that exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, for—</p>

(a) The cognizant administrative contracting officer (ACO) is responsible for consent to subcontracts, except when the contracting officer retains the contract for administration or withholds the consent responsibility from delegation to the ACO.

<a name="wp1075027"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contracting officer responsible for consent shall review the contractor&rsquo;s notification and supporting data to ensure that the proposed subcontract is appropriate for the risks involved and consistent with current policy and sound business judgment.</p>

(c) Designation of specific subcontractors during contract negotiations does not in itself satisfy the requirements for advance notification or consent pursuant to the clause at <a href="52_241_244.html#wp1129081">52.244-2</a>. However, if, in the opinion of the contracting officer, the advance notification or consent requirements were satisfied for certain subcontracts evaluated during negotiations, the contracting officer shall identify those subcontracts in paragraph (j) of the clause at <a href="52_241_244.html#wp1129081">52.244-2</a>.

44.203  Consent limitations.</h3>
<a name="wp1075052"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The contracting officer&rsquo;s consent to a subcontract or approval of the contractor&rsquo;s purchasing system does not constitute a determination of the acceptability of the subcontract terms or price, or of the allowability of costs, unless the consent or approval specifies otherwise.</p>

(b) Contracting officers shall not consent to—</p>

<a name="wp1075055"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

      </p>
<a name="wp1075895"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Contracting officers should not refuse consent to a subcontract merely because it contains a clause giving the subcontractor the right of indirect appeal to an agency board of contract appeals if the subcontractor is affected by a dispute between the Government and the prime contractor. Indirect appeal means assertion by the subcontractor of the prime contractor&rsquo;s right to appeal or the prosecution of an appeal by the prime contractor on the subcontractor&rsquo;s behalf. The clause may also provide that the prime contractor and subcontractor shall be equally bound by the contracting officer&rsquo;s or board&rsquo;s decision. The clause may not attempt to obligate the contracting officer or the appeals board to decide questions that do not arise between the Government and the prime contractor or that are not cognizable under the clause at <a href="52_233_240.html#wp1113304">52.233-1</a>, Disputes.
