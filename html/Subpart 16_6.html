(a) A letter contract may be used when (1) the Government&rsquo;s interests demand that the contractor be given a binding commitment so that work can start immediately and (2) negotiating a definitive contract is not possible in sufficient time to meet the requirement.

The schedule will provide for definitization of the contract within 180 days after the date of the letter contract or before completion of 40 percent of the work to be performed, whichever occurs first. However, the contracting officer may, in extreme cases and according to agency procedures, authorize an additional period. If, after exhausting all reasonable efforts, the contracting officer and the contractor cannot negotiate a definitive contract because of failure to reach agreement as to price or fee, the clause at <a href="52_216.html#wp1115095">52.216-25</a> requires the contractor to proceed with the work and provides that the contracting officer may, with the approval of the head of the contracting activity, determine a reasonable price or fee in accordance with <a href="Subpart%2015_4.html#wp1208365">Subpart 15.4</a> and <a href="FARTOCP31.html#wp253693">Part 31</a>, subject to appeal as provided in the Disputes clause.
