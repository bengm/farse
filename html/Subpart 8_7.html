<a name="wp1103517"> </a><p class="pBody">
Central nonprofit agencies may authorize ordering offices to transmit orders for specific supplies or services directly to an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency.

<a name="wp1103518"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
8.705-3  Allocation process.</h3>
<a name="wp1103519"> </a><p class="pBody">

<a name="wp1103529"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) When an AbilityOne participating nonprofit agency fails to perform under the terms of an order, the ordering office shall make every effort to resolve the noncompliance with the nonprofit agency involved and to negotiate an adjustment before taking action to cancel the order. If the problem cannot be resolved with the nonprofit agency, the ordering office shall refer the matter for resolution first to the central nonprofit agency and then, if necessary, to the Committee.</p>
<a name="wp1103530"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) When, after complying with <a href="#wp1103526">8.705-4</a>(c), the ordering office determines that it must cancel an order, it shall notify the central nonprofit agency and, if practical, request a reallocation of the order.
