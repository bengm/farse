17.200  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1078105"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for the use of option solicitation provisions and contract clauses. Except as provided in agency regulations, this subpart does not apply to contracts for (a) services involving the construction, alteration, or repair (including dredging, excavating, and painting) of buildings, bridges, roads, or other kinds of real property; (b) architect-engineer services; and (c) research and development services. However, it does not preclude the use of options in those contracts.</p>

<a name="wp1078107"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
17.202  Use of options.</h3>
<a name="wp1078108"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, for both sealed bidding and contracting by negotiation, the contracting officer may include options in contracts when it is in the Government&rsquo;s interest. When using sealed bidding, the contracting officer shall make a written determination that there is a reasonable likelihood that the options will be exercised before including the provision at <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1135872">52.217-5</a>, Evaluation of Options, in the solicitation.

<a name="wp1078109"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Inclusion of an option is normally not in the Government&rsquo;s interest when, in the judgment of the contracting officer—</p>

(i) Minimum economic quantities (<em class="cEmphasis">i.e., </em>quantities large enough to permit the recovery of startup costs and the production of the required supplies at a reasonable price); and

(ii) Delivery requirements far enough into the future to permit competitive acquisition, production, and delivery.</p>
<a name="wp1078113"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) An indefinite quantity or requirements contract would be more appropriate than a contract with options. However, this does not preclude the use of an indefinite quantity contract or requirements contract with options.</p>
<a name="wp1078114"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The contracting officer shall not employ options if—</p>
<a name="wp1078115"> </a><p class="pIndented1">

(i) The basic quantity is a learning or testing quantity; and</p>
<a name="wp1078119"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Competition for the option is impracticable once the initial contract is awarded.</p>
<a name="wp1078120"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) In recognition of—</p>
<a name="wp1078121"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The Government&rsquo;s need in certain service contracts for continuity of operations; and</p>
<a name="wp1078122"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The potential cost of disrupted support, options may be included in service contracts if there is an anticipated need for a similar service beyond the first contract period.</p>

17.203  Solicitations.</h3>
<a name="wp1078124"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Solicitations shall include appropriate option provisions and clauses when resulting contracts will provide for the exercise of options (see <a href="#wp1078175">17.208</a>).

(c) Solicitations normally should allow option quantities to be offered without limitation as to price, and there shall be no limitation as to price if the option quantity is to be considered in the evaluation for award (see <a href="#wp1078150">17.206</a>).
      </p>
<a name="wp1078127"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Solicitations that allow the offer of options at unit prices which differ from the unit prices for the basic requirement shall state that offerors may offer varying prices for options, depending on the quantities actually ordered and the dates when ordered.</p>

(e) If it is anticipated that the Government may exercise an option at the time of award and if the condition specified in paragraph (d) of this section applies, solicitations shall specify the price at which the Government will evaluate the option (highest option price offered or option price for specified requirements).</p>
<a name="wp1078129"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Solicitations may, in unusual circumstances, require that options be offered at prices no higher than those for the initial requirement; <em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>when—

<a name="wp1078133"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Specify that the Government will accept an offer containing an option price higher than the base price only if the acceptance does not prejudice any other offeror; and</p>
<a name="wp1078134"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Limit option quantities for additional supplies to not more than 50 percent of the initial quantity of the same contract line item. In unusual circumstances, an authorized person at a level above the contracting officer may approve a greater percentage of quantity.</p>
<a name="wp1078135"> </a><p class="pBody">
(h) Include the value of options in determining if the acquisition will exceed the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement or Free Trade Agreement thresholds.</p>

17.204  Contracts.</h3>
<a name="wp1078137"> </a><p class="pBody">

<a name="wp1078138"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contract shall state the period within which the option may be exercised.</p>
<a name="wp1078139"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The period shall be set so as to provide the contractor adequate lead time to ensure continuous production.</p>
<a name="wp1078140"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The period may extend beyond the contract completion date for service contracts. This is necessary for situations when exercise of the option would result in the obligation of funds that are not available in the fiscal year in which the contract would otherwise be completed.</p>
<a name="wp1078141"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Unless otherwise approved in accordance with agency procedures, the total of the basic and option periods shall not exceed 5 years in the case of services, and the total of the basic and option quantities shall not exceed the requirement for 5 years in the case of supplies. These limitations do not apply to information technology contracts. However, statutes applicable to various classes of contracts, for example, the Service Contract Labor Standards statute (see <a href="Subpart%2022_10.html#wp1105140">22.1002-1</a>), may place additional restrictions on the length of contracts.

<a name="wp1078149"> </a><p class="pBody">

<a name="wp1078150"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
17.206  Evaluation.</h3>
<a name="wp1078151"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) In awarding the basic contract, the contracting officer shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, evaluate offers for any option quantities or periods contained in a solicitation when it has been determined prior to soliciting offers that the Government is likely to exercise the options. (See <a href="#wp1078175">17.208</a>.)
      </p>
<a name="wp1078152"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contracting officer need not evaluate offers for any option quantities when it is determined that evaluation would not be in the best interests of the Government and this determination is approved at a level above the contracting officer. An example of a circumstance that may support a determination not to evaluate offers for option quantities is when there is a reasonable certainty that funds will be unavailable to permit exercise of the option.</p>
<a name="wp1078153"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
17.207  Exercise of options.</h3>
<a name="wp1078154"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When exercising an option, the contracting officer shall provide written notice to the contractor within the time period specified in the contract.</p>
<a name="wp1078155"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) When the contract provides for economic price adjustment and the contractor requests a revision of the price, the contracting officer shall determine the effect of the adjustment on prices under the option before the option is exercised.</p>
<a name="wp1078156"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The contracting officer may exercise options only after determining that—</p>
<a name="wp1078157"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Funds are available;</p>
<a name="wp1078158"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The requirement covered by the option fulfills an existing Government need;</p>

(3) The exercise of the option is the most advantageous method of fulfilling the Government&rsquo;s need, price and other factors (see paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section) considered; </p>
<a name="wp1078160"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The option was synopsized in accordance with <a href="FARTOCP05.html#wp290921">Part 5</a> unless exempted by <a href="Subpart%205_2.html#wp1107990">5.202</a>(a)(11) or other appropriate exemptions in <a href="Subpart%205_2.html#wp1107990">5.202</a>;

<a name="wp1078161"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) The contracting officer, after considering price and other factors, shall make the determination on the basis of one of the following:</p>
<a name="wp1078162"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) A new solicitation fails to produce a better price or a more advantageous offer than that offered by the option. If it is anticipated that the best price available is the option price or that this is the more advantageous offer, the contracting officer should not use this method of testing the market.</p>
<a name="wp1078163"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) An informal analysis of prices or an examination of the market indicates that the option price is better than prices available in the market or that the option is the more advantageous offer.</p>
<a name="wp1078164"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The time between the award of the contract containing the option and the exercise of the option is so short that it indicates the option price is the lowest price obtainable or the more advantageous offer. The contracting officer shall take into consideration such factors as market stability and comparison of the time since award with the usual duration of contracts for such supplies or services.</p>
<a name="wp1079148"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) The determination of other factors under paragraph (c)(3) of this section<em class="cEmphasis">—</em></p>

(2) May consider the effect on small business.</p>
<a name="wp1078166"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Before exercising an option, the contracting officer shall make a written determination for the contract file that exercise is in accordance with the terms of the option, the requirements of this section, and <a href="FARTOCP06.html#wp280339">Part 6</a>. To satisfy requirements of <a href="FARTOCP06.html#wp280339">Part 6</a> regarding full and open competition, the option must have been evaluated as part of the initial competition and be exercisable at an amount specified in or reasonably determinable from the terms of the basic contract, <em class="cEmphasis">e.g.—</em></p>
