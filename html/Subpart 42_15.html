42.1500  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1076343"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart provides policies and establishes responsibilities for recording and maintaining contractor performance information. This subpart does not apply to procedures used by agencies in determining fees under award or incentive fee contracts. See subpart <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078212">16.4</a>. However, the fee amount paid to contractors should be reflective of the contractor&rsquo;s performance and the past performance evaluation should closely parallel and be consistent with the fee determinations.

(b) Agencies shall monitor their compliance with the past performance evaluation requirements (see <a href="#wp1075416">42.1502</a>), and use the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) and Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) metric tools to measure the quality and timely reporting of past performance information.

<a name="wp1075416"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
42.1502  Policy.</h3>
<a name="wp1075893"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) General. Past performance evaluations shall be prepared at least annually and at the time the work under a contract or order is completed. Past performance evaluations are required for contracts and orders as specified in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section, including contracts and orders performed outside the United States. These evaluations are generally for the entity, division, or unit that performed the contract or order. Past performance information shall be entered into CPARS, the Governmentwide evaluation reporting tool for all past performance reports on contracts and orders. Instructions for submitting evaluations into CPARS are available at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpars.gov/">http://www.cpars.gov/</a>.
      </p>
<a name="wp1075894"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contracts. Except as provided in paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of this section, agencies shall prepare evaluations of contractor performance for each contract (as defined in FAR part 2) that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold and for each order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. Agencies are required to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the contract causes the dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<a name="wp1075895"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Orders under multiple-agency contracts. Agencies shall prepare an evaluation of contractor performance for each order that exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold that is placed under a Federal Supply Schedule contract or placed under a task-order contract or a delivery-order contract awarded by another agency (i.e., Governmentwide acquisition contract or multi-agency contract). Agencies placing orders under their own multiple-agency contract shall also prepare evaluations for their own orders. This evaluation shall not consider the requirements under paragraph (g) of this section. Agencies are required to prepare an evaluation if a modification to the order causes the dollar amount to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>
<a name="wp1075896"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Orders under single-agency contracts. For single-agency task-order and delivery-order contracts, the contracting officer may require performance evaluations for each order in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold when such evaluations would produce more useful past performance information for source selection officials than that contained in the overall contract evaluation (e.g., when the scope of the basic contract is very broad and the nature of individual orders could be significantly different). This evaluation need not consider the requirements under paragraph (g) of this section unless the contracting officer deems it appropriate.</p>
<a name="wp1075897"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each construction contract of $700,000 or more, and for each construction contract terminated for default regardless of contract value. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for construction contracts below $700,000.</p>
<a name="wp1075898"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Past performance evaluations shall be prepared for each architect-engineer services contract of $35,000 or more, and for each architect-engineer services contract that is terminated for default regardless of contract value. Past performance evaluations may also be prepared for architect-engineer services contracts below $35,000.</p>
<a name="wp1075899"> </a><p class="pBody">
(g) Past performance evaluations shall include an assessment of contractor performance against, and efforts to achieve, the goals identified in the small business subcontracting plan when the contract includes the clause at <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1136058">52.219-9</a>, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

(ii) Identify and assign past performance evaluation roles and responsibilities to those individuals responsible for preparing and reviewing interim evaluations, if prepared, and final evaluations (e.g., contracting officers, contracting officer representatives, project managers, and program managers).  Those individuals identified may obtain information for the evaluation of performance from the program office, administrative contracting office, audit office, end users of the product or service, and any other technical or business advisor, as appropriate; and</p>

(2) If agency procedures do not specify the individuals responsible for past performance evaluation duties, the contracting officer is responsible for this function.</p>
<a name="wp1076498"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Interim evaluations may be prepared as required, in accordance with agency procedures.</p>
<a name="wp1075994"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b)(1) The evaluation should include a clear, non-technical description of the principal purpose of the contract or order.  The evaluation should reflect how the contractor performed.  The evaluation should include clear relevant information that accurately depicts the contractor&rsquo;s performance, and be based on objective facts supported by program and contract or order performance data. The evaluations should be tailored to the contract type, size, content, and complexity of the contractual requirements.</p>
<a name="wp1076511"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Evaluation factors for each assessment shall include, at a minimum, the following:</p>
<a name="wp1076524"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Technical (quality of product or service).</p>
<a name="wp1076525"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Cost control (not applicable for firm-fixed-price or fixed-price with economic price adjustment arrangements).</p>
<a name="wp1076526"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Schedule/timeliness.</p>
<a name="wp1076527"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) Management or business relations.</p>
<a name="wp1076528"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Small business subcontracting (as applicable, see Table 42-2).</p>
<a name="wp1076529"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) Other (as applicable) (e.g., late or nonpayment to subcontractors, trafficking violations, tax delinquency, failure to report in accordance with contract terms and conditions, defective cost or pricing data, terminations, suspension and debarments).</p>
<a name="wp1076552"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Evaluation factors may include subfactors.  </p>
<a name="wp1076553"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Each factor and subfactor used shall be evaluated and a supporting narrative provided. Each evaluation factor, as listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall be rated in accordance with a five scale rating system (i.e., exceptional, very good, satisfactory, marginal, and unsatisfactory). The ratings and narratives must reflect the definitions in the tables 42-1 or 42-2 of this section.</p>
<a name="wp1076025"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c)(1) When the contract provides for incentive fees, the incentive-fee contract performance evaluation shall be entered into CPARS.</p>
<a name="wp1076565"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) When the contract provides for award fee, the award fee-contract performance adjectival rating as described in <a href="Subpart%2016_4.html#wp1078213">16.401</a>(e)(3) shall be entered into CPARS.
      </p>
<a name="wp1078350"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Agency evaluations of contractor performance, including both negative and positive evaluations, prepared under this subpart shall be provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of the evaluation. The contractor will receive a CPARS-system generated notification when an evaluation is ready for comment. Contractors shall be afforded up to 14 calendar days from the date of notification of availability of the past performance evaluation to submit comments, rebutting statements, or additional information. Agencies shall provide for review at a level above the contracting officer to consider disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation. The ultimate conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the contracting agency. Copies of the evaluation, contractor response, and review comments, if any, shall be retained as part of the evaluation. These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions, and should therefore be marked &ldquo;Source Selection Information&rdquo;.  Evaluation of Federal Prison Industries (FPI) performance may be used to support a waiver request (see <a href="Subpart%208_6.html#wp1075807">8.604</a>) when FPI is a mandatory source in accordance with subpart <a href="Subpart%208_6.html#wp1075770">8.6</a>. The completed evaluation shall not be released to other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is being evaluated during the period the information may be used to provide source selection information. Disclosure of such information could cause harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the competitive position of the contractor being evaluated as well as impede the efficiency of Government operations. Evaluations used in determining award or incentive fee payments may also be used to satisfy the requirements of this subpart. A copy of the annual or final past performance evaluation shall be provided to the contractor as soon as it is finalized.

<a name="wp1076027"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Agencies shall require frequent evaluation (e.g., monthly, quarterly) of agency compliance with the reporting requirements in 42.1502, so agencies can readily identify delinquent past performance reports and monitor their reports for quality control.</p>

(f) Agencies shall prepare and submit all past performance evaluations electronically in the CPARS at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpars.gov/">http://www.cpars.gov/</a>. These evaluations, including any contractor-submitted information (with indication whether agency review is pending), are automatically transmitted to PPIRS at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ppirs.gov">http://www.ppirs.gov</a>. not later than 14 days after the date on which the contractor is notified of the evaluation&rsquo;s availability for comment. The Government shall update PPIRS with any contractor comments provided after 14 days, as well as any subsequent agency review of comments received. Past performance evaluations for classified contracts and special access programs shall not be reported in CPARS, but will be reported as stated in this subpart and in accordance with agency procedures. Agencies shall ensure that appropriate management and technical controls are in place to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to the data and the information safeguarded in accordance with <a href="#wp1076075">42.1503</a>(d).

To justify an Exceptional rating, identify multiple significant events and state how they were a benefit to small business utilization. A singular benefit, however, could be of such magnitude that it constitutes an Exceptional rating. Small businesses should be given meaningful and innovative work directly related to the contract, and opportunities should not be limited to indirect work such as cleaning offices, supplies, landscaping, etc. Also, there should have been no significant weaknesses identified.</p>

To justify a Satisfactory rating, there should have been only minor problems, or major problems the contractor has addressed or taken corrective action. There should have been no significant weaknesses identified. A fundamental principle of assigning ratings is that contractors will not be assessed a rating lower than Satisfactory solely for not performing beyond the requirements of the contract/order. </p>

To justify an Unsatisfactory rating, identify multiple significant events that the contractor had trouble overcoming and state how it impacted small business utilization.  A singular problem, however, could be of such serious magnitude that it alone constitutes an Unsatisfactory rating. An Unsatisfactory rating should be supported by referencing the actions taken by the government to notify the contractor of the deficiencies. When an Unsatisfactory rating is justified, the contracting officer must consider whether the contractor made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the subcontracting plan required by FAR <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1136058">52.219-9</a> and follow the procedures outlined in FAR <a href="52_217_221.html#wp1136186">52.219-16</a>, Liquidated Damages-Subcontracting Plan.
