Contracting officers shall— </p>

(a) Purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. In establishing the reasonableness of the offered prices, the contracting officer—</p>

(4) <em class="cEmphasis">Waivers</em>. The head of the contracting activity (HCA) may, without power of delegation, waive the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data in exceptional cases. The authorization for the waiver and the supporting rationale shall be in writing. The HCA may consider waiving the requirement if the price can be determined to be fair and reasonable without submission of certified cost or pricing data. For example, if certified cost or pricing data were furnished on previous production buys and the contracting officer determines such data are sufficient, when combined with updated data, a waiver may be granted. If the HCA has waived the requirement for submission of certified cost or pricing data, the contractor or higher-tier subcontractor to whom the waiver relates shall be considered as having been required to provide certified cost or pricing data. Consequently, award of any lower-tier subcontract expected to exceed the certified cost or pricing data threshold requires the submission of certified cost or pricing data unless—

(1) In those acquisitions that do not require certified cost or pricing data, the contracting officer shall—</p>
<a name="wp1224875"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Obtain whatever data are available from Government or other secondary sources and use that data in determining a fair and reasonable price;</p>

(iii) Consider whether cost data are necessary to determine a fair and reasonable price when there is not adequate price competition;</p>

(iv) Require that the data submitted by the offeror include, at a minimum, appropriate data on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price unless an exception under <a href="#wp1208385">15.403-1</a>(b)(1) or (2) applies; and
      </p>
<a name="wp1224879"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Consider the guidance in section 3.3, chapter 3, volume I, of the Contract Pricing Reference Guide cited at <a href="#wp1225484">15.404-1</a>(a)(7) to determine the data an offeror shall be required to submit.
      </p>
<a name="wp1224880"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The contractor&rsquo;s format for submitting the data should be used (see <a href="#wp1225419">15.403-5</a>(b)(2)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1224881"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer shall ensure that data used to support price negotiations are sufficiently current to permit negotiation of a fair and reasonable price. Requests for updated offeror data should be limited to data that affect the adequacy of the proposal for negotiations, such as changes in price lists.</p>
<a name="wp1224882"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) As specified in section 808 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Pub. L. 105-261), an offeror who does not comply with a requirement to submit data for a contract or subcontract in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection is ineligible for award unless the HCA determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to make the award to that offeror, based on consideration of the following:</p>
<a name="wp1224883"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) The effort made to obtain the data.</p>
<a name="wp1224884"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The need for the item or service.</p>
<a name="wp1224885"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Increased cost or significant harm to the Government if award is not made.</p>
<a name="wp1224977"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Adequate price competition. When adequate price competition exists (see <a href="#wp1208385">15.403-1</a>(c)(1)), generally no additional data are necessary to determine the reasonableness of price. However, if there are unusual circumstances where it is concluded that additional data are necessary to determine the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer shall, to the maximum extent practicable, obtain the additional data from sources other than the offeror. In addition, the contracting officer should request data to determine the cost realism of competing offers or to evaluate competing approaches.
      </p>
<a name="wp1224978"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Commercial items. </p>
<a name="wp1224979"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) At a minimum, the contracting officer must use price analysis to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable whenever the contracting officer acquires a commercial item (see <a href="#wp1225484">15.404-1</a>(b)). The fact that a price is included in a catalog does not, in and of itself, make it fair and reasonable. If the contracting officer cannot determine whether an offered price is fair and reasonable, even after obtaining additional data from sources other than the offeror, then the contracting officer shall require the offeror to submit data other than certified cost or pricing data to support further analysis (see <a href="#wp1225484">15.404-1</a>). This data may include history of sales to non-governmental and governmental entities, cost data, or any other information the contracting officer requires to determine the price is fair and reasonable. Unless an exception under <a href="#wp1208385">15.403-1</a>(b)(1) or (2) applies, the contracting officer shall require that the data submitted by the offeror include, at a minimum, appropriate data on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price.

(b) Price analysis for commercial and non-commercial items.</p>
<a name="wp1225694"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Price analysis is the process of examining and evaluating a proposed price without evaluating its separate cost elements and proposed profit. Unless an exception from the requirement to obtain certified cost or pricing data applies under <a href="#wp1208385">15.403-1</a>(b)(1) or (b)(2), at a minimum, the contracting officer shall obtain appropriate data, without certification, on the prices at which the same or similar items have previously been sold and determine if the data is adequate for evaluating the reasonableness of the price. Price analysis may include evaluating data other than certified cost or pricing data obtained from the offeror or contractor when there is no other means for determining a fair and reasonable price. Contracting officers shall obtain data other than certified cost or pricing data from the offeror or contractor for all acquisitions (including commercial item acquisitions), if that is the contracting officer&rsquo;s only means to determine the price to be fair and reasonable.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208464"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The Government may use various price analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price. Examples of such techniques include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<a name="wp1225779"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Comparison of proposed prices received in response to the solicitation. Normally, adequate price competition establishes a fair and reasonable price (see <a href="#wp1208385">15.403-1</a>(c)(1)(i)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1225798"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Comparison of the proposed prices to historical prices paid, whether by the Government or other than the Government, for the same or similar items. This method may be used for commercial items including those &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; or requiring minor modifications.</p>
<a name="wp1225799"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) The prior price must be a valid basis for comparison. If there has been a significant time lapse between the last acquisition and the present one, if the terms and conditions of the acquisition are significantly different, or if the reasonableness of the prior price is uncertain, then the prior price may not be a valid basis for comparison.</p>
<a name="wp1225800"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) The prior price must be adjusted to account for materially differing terms and conditions, quantities and market and economic factors. For similar items, the contracting officer must also adjust the prior price to account for material differences between the similar item and the item being procured.</p>
<a name="wp1225801"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(C) Expert technical advice should be obtained when analyzing similar items, or commercial items that are &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; or requiring minor modifications, to ascertain the magnitude of changes required and to assist in pricing the required changes</p>
<a name="wp1225784"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Use of parametric estimating methods/application of rough yardsticks (such as dollars per pound or per horsepower, or other units) to highlight significant inconsistencies that warrant additional pricing inquiry.</p>
<a name="wp1208468"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) Comparison with competitive published price lists, published market prices of commodities, similar indexes, and discount or rebate arrangements.</p>
<a name="wp1208469"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Comparison of proposed prices with independent Government cost estimates.</p>
<a name="wp1208470"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) Comparison of proposed prices with prices obtained through market research for the same or similar items.</p>
<a name="wp1208471"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vii) Analysis of data other than certified cost or pricing data (as defined at <a href="Subpart%202_1.html#wp1145508">2.101</a>) provided by the offeror.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208472"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The first two techniques at <a href="#wp1225484">15.404-1</a>(b)(2) are the preferred techniques. However, if the contracting officer determines that information on competitive proposed prices or previous contract prices is not available or is insufficient to determine that the price is fair and reasonable, the contracting officer may use any of the remaining techniques as appropriate to the circumstances applicable to the acquisition.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208473"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) Value analysis can give insight into the relative worth of a product and the Government may use it in conjunction with the price analysis techniques listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<a name="wp1208474"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Cost analysis.</p>
<a name="wp1208475"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of any separate cost elements and profit or fee in an offeror&rsquo;s or contractor&rsquo;s proposal, as needed to determine a fair and reasonable price or to determine cost realism, and the application of judgment to determine how well the proposed costs represent what the cost of the contract should be, assuming reasonable economy and efficiency.</p>
<a name="wp1208476"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The Government may use various cost analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price, given the circumstances of the acquisition. Such techniques and procedures include the following:</p>
<a name="wp1208477"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Verification of cost data or pricing data and evaluation of cost elements, including—</p>
<a name="wp1208478"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) The necessity for, and reasonableness of, proposed costs, including allowances for contingencies;</p>
<a name="wp1208479"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) Projection of the offeror&rsquo;s cost trends, on the basis of current and historical cost or pricing data;</p>
<a name="wp1208480"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(C) Reasonableness of estimates generated by appropriately calibrated and validated parametric models or cost-estimating relationships; and</p>
<a name="wp1208481"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(D) The application of audited or negotiated indirect cost rates, labor rates, and cost of money or other factors.</p>
<a name="wp1208482"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Evaluating the effect of the offeror&rsquo;s current practices on future costs. In conducting this evaluation, the contracting officer shall ensure that the effects of inefficient or uneconomical past practices are not projected into the future. In pricing production of recently developed complex equipment, the contracting officer should perform a trend analysis of basic labor and materials, even in periods of relative price stability.</p>
<a name="wp1208483"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Comparison of costs proposed by the offeror for individual cost elements with—</p>
<a name="wp1208484"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) Actual costs previously incurred by the same offeror;</p>
<a name="wp1208485"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) Previous cost estimates from the offeror or from other offerors for the same or similar items;</p>
<a name="wp1208486"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(C) Other cost estimates received in response to the Government&rsquo;s request;</p>

(D) Independent Government cost estimates by technical personnel; and</p>
<a name="wp1208488"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(E) Forecasts of planned expenditures.</p>
<a name="wp1208489"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) Verification that the offeror&rsquo;s cost submissions are in accordance with the contract cost principles and procedures in <a href="FARTOCP31.html#wp253693">part 31</a> and, when applicable, the requirements and procedures in 48 CFR Chapter 99 (<a href="APPENDIX_Cover_Sheet.html#wp1348698">Appendix</a> to the FAR looseleaf edition), Cost Accounting Standards.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208490"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Review to determine whether any cost data or pricing data, necessary to make the offeror&rsquo;s proposal suitable for negotiation, have not been either submitted or identified in writing by the offeror. If there are such data, the contracting officer shall attempt to obtain and use them in the negotiations or make satisfactory allowance for the incomplete data.</p>
<a name="wp1208491"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) Analysis of the results of any make-or-buy program reviews, in evaluating subcontract costs (see <a href="#wp1208671">15.407-2</a>).

<a name="wp1208492"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) Cost realism analysis.</p>
<a name="wp1208493"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Cost realism analysis is the process of independently reviewing and evaluating specific elements of each offeror&rsquo;s proposed cost estimate to determine whether the estimated proposed cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the unique methods of performance and materials described in the offeror&rsquo;s technical proposal.</p>
<a name="wp1208494"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Cost realism analyses shall be performed on cost-reimbursement contracts to determine the probable cost of performance for each offeror.</p>
<a name="wp1208495"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) The probable cost may differ from the proposed cost and should reflect the Government&rsquo;s best estimate of the cost of any contract that is most likely to result from the offeror&rsquo;s proposal. The probable cost shall be used for purposes of evaluation to determine the best value.</p>
<a name="wp1208496"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The probable cost is determined by adjusting each offeror&rsquo;s proposed cost, and fee when appropriate, to reflect any additions or reductions in cost elements to realistic levels based on the results of the cost realism analysis.</p>
<a name="wp1208497"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Cost realism analyses may also be used on competitive fixed-price incentive contracts or, in exceptional cases, on other competitive fixed-price-type contracts when new requirements may not be fully understood by competing offerors, there are quality concerns, or past experience indicates that contractors&rsquo; proposed costs have resulted in quality or service shortfalls. Results of the analysis may be used in performance risk assessments and responsibility determinations. However, proposals shall be evaluated using the criteria in the solicitation, and the offered prices shall not be adjusted as a result of the analysis.</p>
<a name="wp1208498"> </a><p class="pBody">
(e) Technical analysis.</p>
<a name="wp1208499"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The contracting officer should request that personnel having specialized knowledge, skills, experience, or capability in engineering, science, or management perform a technical analysis of the proposed types and quantities of materials, labor, processes, special tooling, equipment or real property, the reasonableness of scrap and spoilage, and other associated factors set forth in the proposal(s) in order to determine the need for and reasonableness of the proposed resources, assuming reasonable economy and efficiency.</p>
<a name="wp1225868"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) At a minimum, the technical analysis should examine the types and quantities of material proposed and the need for the types and quantities of labor hours and the labor mix. Any other data that may be pertinent to an assessment of the offeror&rsquo;s ability to accomplish the technical requirements or to the cost or price analysis of the service or product being proposed should also be included in the analysis.</p>
<a name="wp1225869"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer should request technical assistance in evaluating pricing related to items that are &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; items being purchased, or commercial items that are &ldquo;of a type&rdquo; or requiring minor modifications, to ascertain the magnitude of changes required and to assist in pricing the required changes.</p>
<a name="wp1225870"> </a><p class="pBody">
(f) Unit prices.</p>
<a name="wp1208502"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Except when pricing an item on the basis of adequate price competition or catalog or market price, unit prices shall reflect the intrinsic value of an item or service and shall be in proportion to an item&rsquo;s base cost (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>manufacturing or acquisition costs). Any method of distributing costs to line items that distorts the unit prices shall not be used. For example, distributing costs equally among line items is not acceptable except when there is little or no variation in base cost.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208503"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Except for the acquisition of commercial items, contracting officers shall require that offerors identify in their proposals those items of supply that they will not manufacture or to which they will not contribute significant value, unless adequate price competition is expected (<a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">10 U.S.C. 2306a(b)(1)(A(i)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">41 U.S.C. 3503(a)(1)(A)</a>). Such information shall be used to determine whether the intrinsic value of an item has been distorted through application of overhead and whether such items should be considered for breakout. The contracting officer should require such information in all other negotiated contracts when appropriate.

(g) Unbalanced pricing.</p>
<a name="wp1208505"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Unbalanced pricing may increase performance risk and could result in payment of unreasonably high prices. Unbalanced pricing exists when, despite an acceptable total evaluated price, the price of one or more contract line items is significantly over or understated as indicated by the application of cost or price analysis techniques. The greatest risks associated with unbalanced pricing occur when—</p>
<a name="wp1208506"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Startup work, mobilization, first articles, or first article testing are separate line items;</p>

(ii) Base quantities and option quantities are separate line items; or</p>
<a name="wp1208508"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) The evaluated price is the aggregate of estimated quantities to be ordered under separate line items of an indefinite-delivery contract.</p>
<a name="wp1208509"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) All offers with separately priced line items or subline items shall be analyzed to determine if the prices are unbalanced. If cost or price analysis techniques indicate that an offer is unbalanced, the contracting officer shall—</p>

(a) The contracting officer is responsible for the determination of a fair and reasonable price for the prime contract, including subcontracting costs. The contracting officer should consider whether a contractor or subcontractor has an approved purchasing system, has performed cost or price analysis of proposed subcontractor prices, or has negotiated the subcontract prices before negotiation of the prime contract, in determining the reasonableness of the prime contract price.

15.404-4  Profit.</h3>
<a name="wp1208558"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">General</em>. This subsection prescribes policies for establishing the profit or fee portion of the Government prenegotiation objective in price negotiations based on cost analysis.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208559"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Profit or fee prenegotiation objectives do not necessarily represent net income to contractors. Rather, they represent that element of the potential total remuneration that contractors may receive for contract performance over and above allowable costs. This potential remuneration element and the Government&rsquo;s estimate of allowable costs to be incurred in contract performance together equal the Government&rsquo;s total prenegotiation objective. Just as actual costs may vary from estimated costs, the contractor&rsquo;s actual realized profit or fee may vary from negotiated profit or fee, because of such factors as efficiency of performance, incurrence of costs the Government does not recognize as allowable, and the contract type.</p>
<a name="wp1208560"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) It is in the Government&rsquo;s interest to offer contractors opportunities for financial rewards sufficient to stimulate efficient contract performance, attract the best capabilities of qualified large and small business concerns to Government contracts, and maintain a viable industrial base.</p>
<a name="wp1208561"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Both the Government and contractors should be concerned with profit as a motivator of efficient and effective contract performance. Negotiations aimed merely at reducing prices by reducing profit, without proper recognition of the function of profit, are not in the Government&rsquo;s interest. Negotiation of extremely low profits, use of historical averages, or automatic application of predetermined percentages to total estimated costs do not provide proper motivation for optimum contract performance.</p>
<a name="wp1208562"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Policy.</p>
<a name="wp1208563"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Structured approaches (see paragraph (d) of this subsection) for determining profit or fee prenegotiation objectives provide a discipline for ensuring that all relevant factors are considered. Subject to the authorities in <a href="Subpart%201_3.html#wp1050293">1.301</a>(c), agencies making noncompetitive contract awards over $100,000 totaling $50 million or more a year—

(i) Shall use a structured approach for determining the profit or fee objective in those acquisitions that require cost analysis; and</p>

(ii) May prescribe specific exemptions for situations in which mandatory use of a structured approach would be clearly inappropriate.</p>
<a name="wp1208566"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Agencies may use another agency&rsquo;s structured approach.</p>
<a name="wp1208567"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Contracting officer responsibilities.</p>
<a name="wp1208568"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) When the price negotiation is not based on cost analysis, contracting officers are not required to analyze profit.</p>
<a name="wp1208569"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) When the price negotiation is based on cost analysis, contracting officers in agencies that have a structured approach shall use it to analyze profit. When not using a structured approach, contracting officers shall comply with paragraph (d)(1) of this subsection in developing profit or fee prenegotiation objectives.</p>
<a name="wp1208570"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Contracting officers shall use the Government prenegotiation cost objective amounts as the basis for calculating the profit or fee prenegotiation objective. Before applying profit or fee factors, the contracting officer shall exclude from the pre-negotiation cost objective amounts the purchase cost of contractor-acquired property that is categorized as equipment, as defined in FAR <a href="Subpart%2045_1.html#wp1023546">45.101</a>, and where such equipment is to be charged directly to the contract. Before applying profit or fee factors, the contracting officer shall exclude any facilities capital cost of money included in the cost objective amounts. If the prospective contractor fails to identify or propose facilities capital cost of money in a proposal for a contract that will be subject to the cost principles for contracts with commercial organizations (see <a href="Subpart%2031_2.html#wp1095552">Subpart 31.2</a>), facilities capital cost of money will not be an allowable cost in any resulting contract (see <a href="#wp1208736">15.408</a>(i)).

(6) If a change or modification calls for essentially the same type and mix of work as the basic contract and is of relatively small dollar value compared to the total contract value, the contracting officer may use the basic contract&rsquo;s profit or fee rate as the prenegotiation objective for that change or modification.</p>

(1) <em class="cEmphasis">Common factors</em>. Unless it is clearly inappropriate or not applicable, each factor outlined in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (vi) of this subsection shall be considered by agencies in developing their structured approaches and by contracting officers in analyzing profit, whether or not using a structured approach.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208580"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) <em class="cEmphasis">Contractor effort</em>. This factor measures the complexity of the work and the resources required of the prospective contractor for contract performance. Greater profit opportunity should be provided under contracts requiring a high degree of professional and managerial skill and to prospective contractors whose skills, facilities, and technical assets can be expected to lead to efficient and economical contract performance. The subfactors in paragraphs (d)(1)(i)(A) through (D) of this subsection shall be considered in determining contractor effort, but they may be modified in specific situations to accommodate differences in the categories used by prospective contractors for listing costs—
      </p>
<a name="wp1208581"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) <em class="cEmphasis">Material acquisition</em>. This subfactor measures the managerial and technical effort needed to obtain the required purchased parts and material, subcontracted items, and special tooling. Considerations include the complexity of the items required, the number of purchase orders and subcontracts to be awarded and administered, whether established sources are available or new or second sources must be developed, and whether material will be obtained through routine purchase orders or through complex subcontracts requiring detailed specifications. Profit consideration should correspond to the managerial and technical effort involved.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208582"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) <em class="cEmphasis">Conversion direct labor</em>. This subfactor measures the contribution of direct engineering, manufacturing, and other labor to converting the raw materials, data, and subcontracted items into the contract items. Considerations include the diversity of engineering, scientific, and manufacturing labor skills required and the amount and quality of supervision and coordination needed to perform the contract task.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208583"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(C) <em class="cEmphasis">Conversion-related indirect costs</em>. This subfactor measures how much the indirect costs contribute to contract performance. The labor elements in the allocable indirect costs should be given the profit consideration they would receive if treated as direct labor. The other elements of indirect costs should be evaluated to determine whether they merit only limited profit consideration because of their routine nature, or are elements that contribute significantly to the proposed contract.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208584"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(D) <em class="cEmphasis">General management</em>. This subfactor measures the prospective contractor&rsquo;s other indirect costs and general and administrative (G&amp;A) expense, their composition, and how much they contribute to contract performance. Considerations include how labor in the overhead pools would be treated if it were direct labor, whether elements within the pools are routine expenses or instead are elements that contribute significantly to the proposed contract, and whether the elements require routine as opposed to unusual managerial effort and attention.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208585"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Contract cost risk.</p>
<a name="wp1208586"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(A) This factor measures the degree of cost responsibility and associated risk that the prospective contractor will assume as a result of the contract type contemplated and considering the reliability of the cost estimate in relation to the complexity and duration of the contract task. Determination of contract type should be closely related to the risks involved in timely, cost-effective, and efficient performance. This factor should compensate contractors proportionately for assuming greater cost risks.</p>
<a name="wp1208587"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(B) The contractor assumes the greatest cost risk in a closely priced firm-fixed-price contract under which it agrees to perform a complex undertaking on time and at a predetermined price. Some firm-fixed-price contracts may entail substantially less cost risk than others because, for example, the contract task is less complex or many of the contractor&rsquo;s costs are known at the time of price agreement, in which case the risk factor should be reduced accordingly. The contractor assumes the least cost risk in a cost-plus-fixed-fee level-of-effort contract, under which it is reimbursed those costs determined to be allocable and allowable, plus the fixed fee.</p>
<a name="wp1208588"> </a><p class="pIndented3">
(C) In evaluating assumption of cost risk, contracting officers shall, except in unusual circumstances, treat time-and-materials, labor-hour, and firm-fixed-price, level-of-effort term contracts as cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts.</p>
<a name="wp1208589"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) <em class="cEmphasis">Federal socioeconomic programs</em>. This factor measures the degree of support given by the prospective contractor to Federal socioeconomic programs, such as those involving small business concerns, small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, women-owned small business concerns, veteran-owned, HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, sheltered workshops for workers with disabilities, and energy conservation. Greater profit opportunity should be provided contractors that have displayed unusual initiative in these programs.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208590"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) <em class="cEmphasis">Capital investments</em>. This factor takes into account the contribution of contractor investments to efficient and economical contract performance.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208591"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) <em class="cEmphasis">Cost-control and other past accomplishments</em>. This factor allows additional profit opportunities to a prospective contractor that has previously demonstrated its ability to perform similar tasks effectively and economically. In addition, consideration should be given to measures taken by the prospective contractor that result in productivity improvements, and other cost-reduction accomplishments that will benefit the Government in follow-on contracts.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208592"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) <em class="cEmphasis">Independent development</em>. Under this factor, the contractor may be provided additional profit opportunities in recognition of independent development efforts relevant to the contract end item without Government assistance. The contracting officer should consider whether the development cost was recovered directly or indirectly from Government sources.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208593"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) <em class="cEmphasis">Additional factors</em>. In order to foster achievement of program objectives, each agency may include additional factors in its structured approach or take them into account in the profit analysis of individual contract actions.

15.405  Price negotiation.</h3>
<a name="wp1208595"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) The purpose of performing cost or price analysis is to develop a negotiation position that permits the contracting officer and the offeror an opportunity to reach agreement on a fair and reasonable price. A fair and reasonable price does not require that agreement be reached on every element of cost, nor is it mandatory that the agreed price be within the contracting officer&rsquo;s initial negotiation position. Taking into consideration the advisory recommendations, reports of contributing specialists, and the current status of the contractor&rsquo;s purchasing system, the contracting officer is responsible for exercising the requisite judgment needed to reach a negotiated settlement with the offeror and is solely responsible for the final price agreement. However, when significant audit or other specialist recommendations are not adopted, the contracting officer should provide rationale that supports the negotiation result in the price negotiation documentation.</p>
<a name="wp1208596"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) The contracting officer&rsquo;s primary concern is the overall price the Government will actually pay. The contracting officer&rsquo;s objective is to negotiate a contract of a type and with a price providing the contractor the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance. The negotiation of a contract type and a price are related and should be considered together with the issues of risk and uncertainty to the contractor and the Government. Therefore, the contracting officer should not become preoccupied with any single element and should balance the contract type, cost, and profit or fee negotiated to achieve a total result—a price that is fair and reasonable to both the Government and the contractor.</p>
<a name="wp1208597"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) The Government&rsquo;s cost objective and proposed pricing arrangement directly affect the profit or fee objective. Because profit or fee is only one of several interrelated variables, the contracting officer shall not agree on profit or fee without concurrent agreement on cost and type of contract.</p>
<a name="wp1208598"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) If, however, the contractor insists on a price or demands a profit or fee that the contracting officer considers unreasonable, and the contracting officer has taken all authorized actions (including determining the feasibility of developing an alternative source) without success, the contracting officer shall refer the contract action to a level above the contracting officer. Disposition of the action should be documented.</p>

15.407-3  Forward pricing rate agreements.</h3>
<a name="wp1226266"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When certified cost or pricing data are required, offerors are required to describe any forward pricing rate agreements (FPRAs) in each specific pricing proposal to which the rates apply and to identify the latest cost or pricing data already submitted in accordance with the FPRA. All data submitted in connection with the FPRA, updated as necessary, form a part of the total data that the offeror certifies to be accurate, complete, and current at the time of agreement on price for an initial contract or for a contract modification. (See the Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data at <a href="#wp1208603">15.406-2</a>.)

15.407-4  Should-cost review.</h3>
<a name="wp1208706"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) General.</p>
<a name="wp1208707"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Should-cost reviews are a specialized form of cost analysis. Should-cost reviews differ from traditional evaluation methods because they do not assume that a contractor&rsquo;s historical costs reflect efficient and economical operation. Instead, these reviews evaluate the economy and efficiency of the contractor&rsquo;s existing work force, methods, materials, equipment, real property, operating systems, and management. These reviews are accomplished by a multi-functional team of Government contracting, contract administration, pricing, audit, and engineering representatives. The objective of should-cost reviews is to promote both short and long-range improvements in the contractor&rsquo;s economy and efficiency in order to reduce the cost of performance of Government contracts. In addition, by providing rationale for any recommendations and quantifying their impact on cost, the Government will be better able to develop realistic objectives for negotiation.</p>
<a name="wp1208708"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) There are two types of should-cost reviews—program should-cost review (see paragraph (b) of this subsection) and overhead should-cost review (see paragraph (c) of this subsection). These should-cost reviews may be performed together or independently. The scope of a should-cost review can range from a large-scale review examining the contractor&rsquo;s entire operation (including plant-wide overhead and selected major subcontractors) to a small-scale tailored review examining specific portions of a contractor&rsquo;s operation.</p>
<a name="wp1208709"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Program should-cost review.</p>
<a name="wp1208710"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) A program should-cost review is used to evaluate significant elements of direct costs, such as material and labor, and associated indirect costs, usually associated with the production of major systems. When a program should-cost review is conducted relative to a contractor proposal, a separate audit report on the proposal is required.</p>
<a name="wp1208711"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) A program should-cost review should be considered, particularly in the case of a major system acquisition (see <a href="FARTOCP34.html#wp223483">part 34</a>), when—
      </p>
<a name="wp1208712"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Some initial production has already taken place;</p>
<a name="wp1208713"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) The contract will be awarded on a sole source basis;</p>
<a name="wp1208714"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) There are future year production requirements for substantial quantities of like items;</p>
<a name="wp1208715"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) The items being acquired have a history of increasing costs;</p>
<a name="wp1208716"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) The work is sufficiently defined to permit an effective analysis and major changes are unlikely;</p>
<a name="wp1208717"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) Sufficient time is available to plan and adequately conduct the should-cost review; and</p>
<a name="wp1208718"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vii) Personnel with the required skills are available or can be assigned for the duration of the should-cost review.</p>
<a name="wp1208719"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The contracting officer should decide which elements of the contractor&rsquo;s operation have the greatest potential for cost savings and assign the available personnel resources accordingly. The expertise of on-site Government personnel should be used, when appropriate. While the particular elements to be analyzed are a function of the contract work task, elements such as manufacturing, pricing and accounting, management and organization, and subcontract and vendor management are normally reviewed in a should-cost review.</p>
<a name="wp1208720"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) In acquisitions for which a program should-cost review is conducted, a separate program should-cost review team report, prepared in accordance with agency procedures, is required. The contracting officer shall consider the findings and recommendations contained in the program should-cost review team report when negotiating the contract price. After completing the negotiation, the contracting officer shall provide the ACO a report of any identified uneconomical or inefficient practices, together with a report of correction or disposition agreements reached with the contractor. The contracting officer shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices.</p>
<a name="wp1208721"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) When a program should-cost review is planned, the contracting officer should state this fact in the acquisition plan or acquisition plan updates (see <a href="Subpart%207_1.html#wp1098043">Subpart 7.1</a>) and in the solicitation.
      </p>
<a name="wp1208722"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Overhead should-cost review.</p>
<a name="wp1208723"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) An overhead should- cost review is used to evaluate indirect costs, such as fringe benefits, shipping and receiving, real property, and equipment, depreciation, plant maintenance and security, taxes, and general and administrative activities. It is normally used to evaluate and negotiate an FPRA with the contractor. When an overhead should-cost review is conducted, a separate audit report is required.</p>
<a name="wp1208724"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The following factors should be considered when selecting contractor sites for overhead should-cost reviews:</p>
<a name="wp1208725"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Dollar amount of Government business.</p>
<a name="wp1208726"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Level of Government participation.</p>
<a name="wp1208727"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Level of noncompetitive Government contracts.</p>
<a name="wp1208728"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) Volume of proposal activity.</p>
<a name="wp1208729"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Major system or program.</p>
<a name="wp1208730"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) Corporate reorganizations, mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers.</p>
<a name="wp1208731"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vii) Other conditions (<em class="cEmphasis">e.g., </em>changes in accounting systems, management, or business activity).
      </p>
<a name="wp1208732"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) The objective of the overhead should-cost review is to evaluate significant indirect cost elements in-depth, and identify and recommend corrective actions regarding inefficient and uneconomical practices. If it is conducted in conjunction with a program should-cost review, a separate overhead should-cost review report is not required. However, the findings and recommendations of the overhead should-cost team, or any separate overhead should-cost review report, shall be provided to the ACO. The ACO should use this information to form the basis for the Government position in negotiating an FPRA with the contractor. The ACO shall establish a follow-up plan to monitor the correction of the uneconomical or inefficient practices.</p>

15.407-5  Estimating systems.</h3>
<a name="wp1208734"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) Using an acceptable estimating system for proposal preparation benefits both the Government and the contractor by increasing the accuracy and reliability of individual proposals. Cognizant audit activities, when it is appropriate to do so, shall establish and manage regular programs for reviewing selected contractors&rsquo; estimating systems or methods, in order to reduce the scope of reviews to be performed on individual proposals, expedite the negotiation process, and increase the reliability of proposals.
