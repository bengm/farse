As used in this subpart—</p>
<a name="wp1044860"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Data&rdquo; means recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term includes technical data and computer software. The term does not include information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information.</p>
<a name="wp1044861"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Form, fit, and function data&rdquo; means data relating to items, components, or processes that are sufficient to enable physical and functional interchangeability, and data identifying source, size, configuration, mating and attachment characteristics, functional characteristics, and performance requirements.

<a name="wp1044862"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Limited rights&rdquo; means the rights of the Government in limited rights data as set forth in a Limited Rights Notice.</p>
<a name="wp1044863"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Limited rights data&rdquo; means data, other than computer software, that embody trade secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged, to the extent that such data pertain to items, components, or processes developed at private expense, including minor modifications. (Agencies may, however, adopt the following alternate definition: Limited rights data means data (other than computer software) developed at private expense that embody trade secrets or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged (see <a href="#wp1045475">27.404-2</a>(b)).
      </p>
<a name="wp1044864"> </a><p class="pBody">
&ldquo;Restricted computer software&rdquo; means computer software developed at private expense and that is a trade secret, is commercial or financial and confidential or privileged, or is copyrighted computer software, including minor modifications of the computer software.</p>

27.402  Policy.</h3>
<a name="wp1044868"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) To carry out their missions and programs, agencies acquire or obtain access to many kinds of data produced during or used in the performance of their contracts. Agencies require data to—</p>
<a name="wp1044869"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Obtain competition among suppliers;</p>
<a name="wp1044870"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Fulfill certain responsibilities for disseminating and publishing the results of their activities;</p>

<a name="wp1044873"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) Meet specialized acquisition needs and ensure logistics support.</p>
<a name="wp1045332"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) Contractors may have proprietary interests in data. In order to prevent the compromise of these interests, agencies shall protect proprietary data from unauthorized use and disclosure. The protection of such data is also necessary to encourage qualified contractors to participate in and apply innovative concepts to Government programs. In light of these considerations, agencies shall balance the Government&rsquo;s needs and the contractor&rsquo;s legitimate proprietary interests.</p>
<a name="wp1044875"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
27.403  Data rights—General.</h3>
<a name="wp1044876"> </a><p class="pBody">
All contracts that require data to be produced, furnished, acquired, or used in meeting contract performance requirements, must contain terms that delineate the respective rights and obligations of the Government and the contractor regarding the use, reproduction, and disclosure of that data. Data rights clauses do not specify the type, quantity or quality of data that is to be delivered, but only the respective rights of the Government and the contractor regarding the use, disclosure, or reproduction of the data. Accordingly, the contract shall specify the data to be delivered.</p>

27.404-2  Limited rights data and restricted computer software.</h3>
<a name="wp1045476"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) <em class="cEmphasis">General</em>. The basic clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a>, Rights in Data—General, enables the contractor to protect qualifying limited rights data and restricted computer software by withholding the data from the Government and instead delivering form, fit, and function data.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044887"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) <em class="cEmphasis">Alternate definition of limited rights data</em>. For contracts that do not require the development, use, or delivery of items, components, or processes that are intended to be acquired by or for the Government, an agency may adopt the alternate definition of limited rights data set forth in Alternate I to the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a>. The alternate definition does not require that the data pertain to items, components, or processes developed at private expense; but rather that the data were developed at private expense and embody a trade secret or are commercial or financial and confidential or privileged.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044888"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) Protection of limited rights data specified for delivery.</p>
<a name="wp1045068"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) The clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a> with its Alternate II enables the Government to require delivery of limited rights data rather than allow the contractor to withhold the data. To obtain delivery, the contract may identify and specify data to be delivered, or the contracting officer may require, by written request during contract performance, the delivery of data that has been withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause. In addition, the contract may specifically identify data that are not to be delivered under Alternate II or which, if delivered, will be delivered with limited rights. The limited rights obtained by the Government are set forth in the Limited Rights Notice contained in paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II. Agencies shall not, without permission of the contractor, use limited rights data for purposes of manufacture or disclose the data outside the Government except as set forth in the Notice. Any disclosure by the Government shall be subject to prohibition against further use and disclosure by the recipient. The following are examples of specific purposes that may be adopted by an agency in its supplement and added to the Limited Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(3) of Alternate II of the clause:
      </p>
<a name="wp1044889"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Use (except for manufacture) by support service contractors.</p>
<a name="wp1044890"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Evaluation by nongovernment evaluators.</p>
<a name="wp1044891"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Use (except for manufacture) by other contractors participating in the Government&rsquo;s program of which the specific contract is a part.</p>
<a name="wp1044892"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) Emergency repair or overhaul work.</p>
<a name="wp1044893"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Release to a foreign government, or its instrumentalities, if required to serve the interests of the U.S. Government, for information or evaluation, or for emergency repair or overhaul work by the foreign government.</p>
<a name="wp1044894"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The provision at <a href="52_227.html#wp1145584">52.227-15</a>, Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, helps the contracting officer to determine whether the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a> should be used with its Alternate II. This provision requests that an offeror state whether limited rights data are likely to be delivered. Where limited rights data are expected to be delivered, use Alternate II. Where negotiations are based on an unsolicited proposal, the need for Alternate II of the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a> should be addressed during negotiations or discussions, and if Alternate II was not included initially it may be added by modification, if needed, during contract performance.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044895"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) If data that would otherwise qualify as limited rights data is delivered as a computer database, the data shall be treated as limited rights data, rather than restricted computer software, for the purposes of paragraph (g) of the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a>.

(d) Protection of restricted computer software specified for delivery. </p>
<a name="wp1045082"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Alternate III of the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a>, enables the Government to require delivery of restricted computer software rather than allow the contractor to withhold such restricted computer software. To obtain delivery of restricted computer software the contracting officer shall—
      </p>
<a name="wp1044897"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Identify and specify the deliverable computer software in the contract; or</p>
<a name="wp1044898"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Require by written request during contract performance, the delivery of computer software that has been withheld or identified to be withheld under paragraph (g)(1) of the clause.</p>
<a name="wp1044899"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) In considering whether to use Alternate III, contracting officers should note that, unlike other data, computer software is also an end item in itself. Thus, the contracting officer shall use Alternate III if delivery of restricted computer software is required to meet agency needs.</p>
<a name="wp1044900"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Unless otherwise agreed (see paragraph (d)(4) of this subsection), the restricted rights obtained by the Government are set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice contained in paragraph (g)(4) (Alternate III). Such restricted computer software will not be used or reproduced by the Government, or disclosed outside the Government, except that the computer software may be—</p>
<a name="wp1044901"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(i) Used or copied for use with the computers for which it was acquired, including use at any Government installation to which the computers may be transferred;</p>
<a name="wp1044902"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(ii) Used or copied for use with a backup computer if any computer for which it was acquired is inoperative;</p>
<a name="wp1044903"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iii) Reproduced for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes;</p>
<a name="wp1044904"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(iv) Modified, adapted, or combined with other computer software, <em class="cEmphasis">provided</em> that the modified, adapted, or combined portions of the derivative software incorporating any of the delivered, restricted computer software shall be subject to the same restricted rights;
      </p>
<a name="wp1044905"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(v) Disclosed to and reproduced for use by support service contractors or their subcontractors, in accordance with paragraphs (3)(i) through (iv) of this section; and</p>
<a name="wp1044906"> </a><p class="pIndented2">
(vi) Used or copied for use with a replacement computer.</p>
<a name="wp1044907"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(4) The restricted rights set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this subsection are the minimum rights the Government normally obtains with restricted computer software and will automatically apply when such software is acquired under the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a>. However, the contracting officer may specify different rights in the contract, consistent with the purposes and needs for which the software is to be acquired. For example, the contracting officer should consider any networking needs or any requirements for use of the computer software from remote terminals. Also, in addressing such needs, the scope of the restricted rights may be different for the documentation accompanying the computer software than for the programs and databases. Any additions to, or limitations on, the restricted rights set forth in the Restricted Rights Notice of paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III of the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a> shall be expressly stated in the contract or in a collateral agreement incorporated in and made part of the contract, and the notice modified accordingly.
      </p>
<a name="wp1044908"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(5) The provision at <a href="52_227.html#wp1145584">52.227-15</a>, Representation of Limited Rights Data and Restricted Computer Software, helps the contracting officer determine whether to use the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a> with its Alternate III. This provision requests that an offeror state whether restricted computer software is likely to be delivered under the contract. In addition, the need for Alternate III should be addressed during negotiations or discussions with an offeror, particularly where negotiations are based on an unsolicited proposal. However, if Alternate III is not used initially, it may be added by modification, if needed, during contract performance.

(1) Generally, the contractor must obtain permission of the contracting officer prior to asserting rights in any copyrighted work containing data first produced in the performance of a contract.

<a name="wp1044911"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) The contractor must make a written request for permission to assert its copyright in works containing data first produced under the contract. In its request, the contractor should identify the data involved or furnish copies of the data for which permission is requested, as well as a statement as to the intended publication or dissemination media or other purpose for which the permission is requested. Generally, a contracting officer should grant the contractor&rsquo;s request when copyright protection will enhance the appropriate dissemination or use of the data unless the—</p>

(3) Alternate IV of the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a> provides a substitute paragraph (c)(1) granting permission for contractors to assert copyright in any data first produced in the performance of the contract without the need for any further requests. Except for contracts for management or operation of Government facilities and contracts and subcontracts in support of programs being conducted at those facilities or where international agreements require otherwise, Alternate IV shall be used in all contracts for basic or applied research to be performed solely by colleges and universities. Alternate IV shall not be used in contracts with colleges and universities if a purpose of the contract is for development of computer software for distribution to the public (including use in solicitations) by or on behalf of the Government. In addition, Alternate IV may be used in other contracts if an agency determines that it is not necessary for a contractor to request further permission to assert copyright in data first produced in performance of the contract. The contracting officer may exclude any data, or items or categories of data, from the provisions of Alternate IV by expressly so providing in the contract or by adding a paragraph (d)(4) to the clause, consistent with <a href="#wp1044924">27.404-4</a>(b).

(4) Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a>, the contractor grants the Government a paid-up nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute to the public, perform publicly and display publicly by or on behalf of the Government, for all data (other than computer software) first produced in the performance of a contract. For computer software, the scope of the Government&rsquo;s license includes all of the above rights except the right to distribute to the public. Agencies may also obtain a license of different scope if the contracting officer determines, after consulting with legal counsel, such a license will substantially enhance the dissemination of any data first produced under the contract or if such a license is required to comply with international agreements. If an agency obtains a different license, the contractor shall clearly state the scope of that license in a conspicuous place on the medium on which the data is recorded. For example, if the data is delivered as a report, the terms of the license shall be stated on the cover, or first page, of the report.

However, agencies may obtain a license of different scope if the agency determines, after consultation with its legal counsel, that such different license will not be inconsistent with the purpose of acquiring the data. If a license of a different scope is acquired, it must be so stated in the contract and clearly set forth in a conspicuous place on the data when delivered to the Government. If the contractor delivers computer software not first produced under the contract, the contractor shall grant the Government the license set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III if included in the clause at <a href="52_227.html#wp1139363">52.227-14</a>, or a license agreed to in a collateral agreement made part of the contract.

(a) When contracting other than from GSA&rsquo;s Multiple Award Schedule contracts for the acquisition of commercial computer software, no specific contract clause prescribed in this subpart need be used, but the contract shall specifically address the Government&rsquo;s rights to use, disclose, modify, distribute, and reproduce the software. Section <a href="Subpart%2012_2.html#wp1087420">12.212</a> sets forth the guidance for the acquisition of commercial computer software and states that commercial computer software or commercial computer software documentation shall be acquired under licenses customarily provided to the public to the extent the license is consistent with Federal law and otherwise satisfies the Government&rsquo;s needs.

(a) It is the Government&rsquo;s practice to determine, to the extent feasible, its data requirements in time for inclusion in solicitations. The data requirements may be subject to revision during contract negotiations.

Agencies may regulate the use of this authority in their supplements. Lesser rights shall, at a minimum, assure use of the data for agreed-to Governmental purposes (including reprocurement rights as appropriate), and address any disclosure limitations or restrictions to be imposed on the data. Also, consideration may be given to requiring the contractor to directly license others if needed to carry out the objectives of the contract. Since the purpose of the cosponsored research and development, the legitimate proprietary interests of the contractor, the needs of the Government, and the respective contributions of both parties may vary, no specific clauses are prescribed, but a clause providing less than unlimited rights in the Government for data developed and delivered under the contract (such as license rights) may be tailored to the circumstances consistent with the foregoing and the policy set forth in <a href="#wp1044867">27.402</a>.
