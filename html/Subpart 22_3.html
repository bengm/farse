<a name="wp1081697"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.300  Scope of subpart.</h3>
<a name="wp1082293"> </a><p class="pBody">
This subpart prescribes policies and procedures for applying the requirements of <a target="_blank" href="http://uscode.house.gov/">40 U.S.C. chapter 37</a>, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards (the statute) to contracts that may require or involve laborers or mechanics.  In this subpart, the term &ldquo;laborers or mechanics&rdquo; includes apprentices, trainees, helpers, watchmen, guards, firefighters, fireguards, and workmen who perform services in connection with dredging or rock excavation in rivers or harbors, but does not include any employee employed as a seaman.
      </p>
<a name="wp1081699"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.301  Statutory requirement.</h3>
<a name="wp1081700"> </a><p class="pBody">
The statute requires that certain contracts contain a clause specifying that no laborer or mechanic doing any part of the work contemplated by the contract shall be required or permitted to work more than 40 hours in any workweek unless paid for all such overtime hours at not less than 1 1/2 times the basic rate of pay.</p>
<a name="wp1081701"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.302  Liquidated damages and overtime pay.</h3>
<a name="wp1081702"> </a><p class="pBody">
(a) When an overtime computation discloses under-payments, the responsible contractor or subcontractor must pay the affected employee any unpaid wages and pay liquidated damages to the Government. The contracting officer must assess liquidated damages at the rate of $10 per affected employee for each calendar day on which the employer required or permitted the employee to work in excess of the standard workweek of 40 hours without paying overtime wages required by the statute.</p>
<a name="wp1081703"> </a><p class="pBody">
(b) If the contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with overtime pay requirements of the statute and the funds withheld by Federal agencies for labor standards violations do not cover the unpaid wages due laborers and mechanics and the liquidated damages due the Government, make payments in the following order—</p>
<a name="wp1081704"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Pay laborers and mechanics the wages they are owed (or prorate available funds if they do not cover the entire amount owed); and</p>
<a name="wp1081705"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Pay liquidated damages.</p>
<a name="wp1081706"> </a><p class="pBody">
(c) If the head of an agency finds that the administratively determined liquidated damages due under paragraph (a) of this section are incorrect, or that the contractor or subcontractor inadvertently violated the statute despite the exercise of due care, the agency head may—</p>
<a name="wp1081707"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(1) Reduce the amount of liquidated damages assessed for liquidated damages of $500 or less;</p>
<a name="wp1081708"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(2) Release the contractor or subcontractor from the liability for liquidated damages of $500 or less; or</p>
<a name="wp1081709"> </a><p class="pIndented1">
(3) Recommend that the Secretary of Labor reduce or waive liquidated damages over $500.</p>
<a name="wp1081710"> </a><p class="pBody">
(d) After the contracting officer determines the liquidated damages and the contractor makes appropriate payments, disburse any remaining assessments in accordance with agency procedures.</p>
<a name="wp1081711"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.303  Administration and enforcement.</h3>
<a name="wp1081712"> </a><p class="pBody">
The procedures and reports required for construction contracts in <a href="Subpart%2022_4.html#wp1101814">subpart 22.4</a> also apply to investigations of alleged violations of the statute on other than construction contracts.
      </p>
<a name="wp1081713"> </a><h3 class="pSection">
22.304  Variations, tolerances, and exemptions.</h3>

<a name="wp1081715"> </a><p class="pBody">
